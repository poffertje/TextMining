Hubs ordered the burger and I had the cuban sandwich, while we started with the deviled eggs. Deviled eggs - good, but not amazing Burger & fries - burger was definitely very tender, but nothing to write home about. I liked it more than my husband since I actually like bleu cheese. The fries were nice n crispy but kinda hard to eat. Cuban sandiwch - nicely served hot, but again.. not amazing. Wouldn't come back, especially given the extremely long wait.",0

It's not like they need another review - but if, like me, you just didn't want to deal with all the hoopla - you might find yourself wishing you hadn't avoided the place for so long.",1

11806,1814,3.0,1,2010-09-10,"I've been trying to dine here since 2008 and I finally did it. In my past attempts, the issue was either the wait was ridiculously long or the kitchen had closed. If you can imagine, my expectation had been building up over the years. Last night, in my triumphant state I ordered the burger and was deeply disappointed. The shoestring fries were okay, but the only thing that really separates it from regular fries was the rosemary. Nice touch, but no homerun. The burger... correction: the $17 burger wasn't too special either. It really had me thinking a burger is a burger is a burger (with the exception of Five Napkins and Shake Shack). Sorry, overglorified dining is not for me.",0
33573,1814,4.0,1,2011-01-23,"On a Sunday before a Monday holiday, a friend and I randomly wandered up to NYC from Philadelphia, in part because my friend wanted to check out The Spotted Pig. And really - is there a better reason for a random road trip than good food and drink?! In any case, we arrived at The Spotted Pig a bit on the later side for dinner, I want to say around 10:00pm. But there was no rush as the kitchen doesn't close till 2am. We didn't have a reservation and there was a little bit of a wait - maybe 15 minutes or so - until we were seated. And the place was full - but not overwhelmingly so. The first floor features a compact bar with a small dining room. The second floor offers more tables, another bar and is a bit more spacious - that's where we were seated. The place is warm, cozy and chock full of various pig things - no surprise there. Low lighting and a very relaxed feel - intimate, but with great energy. Groups maneuvered in and out with little difficulty despite the small space. We split the burger and my companion was rather delighted that every available surface of the bun was toasted. The accompanying shoestring fries were addictive. Before that we went a bit devious and ordered the Deviled Eggs AND the Devils on Hoseback (bacon wrapped oysters), which were polished off in very short order. And the gnudi - heavenly little dumplings filled with ricotta - is a must. I'm salivating just thinking about the dish. There are no words to describe the extent of the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. As for beverages, he ordered a few beers and I stuck with the Pimm's Cup -  pleasant reminder of my time spent in England. We lingered comfortably over our meal and drinks till about 1:30ish and I'll def make a point to go back next time I'm in NYC. Solid gastropub experience.",1
9606,1814,4.0,1,2010-07-12,"Believe the hype.  The food here is delish, fat laden, and flavorful.  You will indulge and you'll love every minute of it.  We came here for dinner on the 4th of July and learned that we had just missed lunch so we had to wait another hour for dinner.  In the interim we sat at the bar upstairs and ordered shoestring fries and pickled herring which were both great. By the time we were ready to have dinner we were pretty full off of fries and beer so we split a burger and a side of broccoli with bacon. The burger is really rich, in fact we both didn't finish our halves.  It was also a bit too salty and I'm a proponent for high sodium diets!  The broccoli and bacon literally melted in my mouth and had a little kick to it. It was so freakin' good.",1

126221,1814,4.0,1,2008-02-12,"I took my brother and sister here for dinner the other night and we had a very good time.  It was loud and crowded, and the wait was pretty long, but we had fun. For appetizers we had the duck's egg and bacon salad and the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, both of which I thought were really good.  My sister and I had the burger, medium rare, which I thought was very good, though my sister thought the roquefort was maybe a little bit too overwhelming.  I liked the thinness and seasoning of the fries and didn't think they were too salty as some commenters have.  My brother had the quail with the pomegranate sauce.  I only had a small bite of it, but he loved it.  The only disappointment was the dessert.  We ordered a slice of chocolate amaretto cake which was just too dry. Not the best food I've ever had, but it's a fun place with respectable food that I would definitely recommend.",1
125321,1814,2.0,-1,2014-08-21,"Nice looking funky spot with an upstairs bar, but surely over-rated by the people who crowd into that spot every night. They had a good IPA on tap, but the signature burger had a sharp skunky cheese on it that was less than adept, and the shoe string fries, though nice with the rosemary, were so small that it was impractical to eat. Oh, yeah, and overpriced no doubt. Burger was over $20 and like I said was not good. I'd suggest that the place revamp and recharge or get out while it's still somewhat cool.",0
79292,1814,5.0,1,2009-11-15,"The Spotted Pig is a place I have been hoping to experience for some time.  Happily, I got to visit it a couple of times on a recent visit to Manhattan.  I'm not sure why, but I'm on a gastropub kick.  Unfortunately, there aren't really any gastropubs near where I live.  So, how do I satisfy the jones?  Well, I had to hit up two of them while visiting Manhattan.  Otherwise, I just have to have some of the bar menu items at my favorite local restaurants or some of the decent items at my favorite local microbrewery.  That seems to be as close as I can get in my town. The Spotted Pig Bitter was quite good.  I also enjoyed the great chicken liver toast that I shared with my friend.  That was the first time we went there that weekend. After the theater, dinner, and a little sightseeing on the Sunday of that weekend, we decided to go to The Spotted Pig so I could get myself a T-shirt and, well, to eat there again.  We got the chicken liver toast again.  I got the Bath Chap, which is like a patty of braised pork, breaded and fried.  Served with it was a little salad and chanterelles.  I also got the poached duck egg with lamb tongue and flageolets.  Both dishes were executed wonderfully and had great seasoning and balance as well.  I can't say enough good things about the offal I had there.  Likewise, the braised pork was wonderfully tender and moist. My only regret was that I couldn't eat there more!",1
41294,1814,5.0,1,2014-01-01,"I love, love, love this place. The shoestring  fries, the cheese plate, the steak, all perfect. I had rosé and a different sparkling drink both were good.

15900,1814,4.0,1,2011-05-18,"You know the drill from the countless other reviews this place has... Spotted Pig is a total pain, in the you know what, to get a table at no matter if it is 11AM on a Sunday or 11PM on a Wednesday. Finally, karma was on my side a few nights ago!! We scored a table without waiting!!!! In oddly enough the same table I sat in the last time I was here. Sorry but I can't tell you when.... I can't dare risk jinxing this. The service was friendly and the food outstanding as usual. The chicken liver toast was spot on. The burgers excellent as always (not as much cheese as usual which made me quite happy) with an almost comically massive pile of fries that must be finished no matter what. The real star of this meal though was the soft shell crab. I am a soft shell crab fiend and always insist on ordering it whenever in season. I had never seen it on the menu here before and didn't expect much but the British twist on this was divine. The crab was perfectly cooked in this luscious, almost tempura like batter. It was freaking amazing. We inhaled it and wished there had been more crab. I can't believe I am saying this but this was the best soft shell crab I have ever had. All in all a great meal. The waiter charged us for a coffee we didn't have which was pretty annoying but fixed it. There is one thing I wish would change about this place.... Where's mayo? Perhaps I should write a letter...",1
125675,1814,5.0,1,2014-08-04,"One of the best burgers I've ever had the pleasure consuming! I'm not one for shoestring fries, but they did go really well when added atop the gorgeously cooked meat. Also, the pumpkin salad (special) was absolutely incredible! Not a lot of room to enjoy your food, but well worth making the trip, just to enjoy their burger!",1
107401,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-17,I checked out this place last Saturday. So much fun! The bartender was super cool and the drinks were perfect! Got the famous burger with fries. AMAZING! SO FREAKIN GOOD! The place is pretty small but definitely worth the hype.,1
125985,1814,3.0,1,2011-07-24,"I ate here with a pal on a Friday around noon. It wasn't very busy, yet we were seated exactly where everyone else was upstairs. That was odd. Anyway, I am a bit of a picky eater, and there wasn't much on the menu that I'd try, let alone pay for. I settled on a burger, and I was not disappointed. It was delicious! It took a while to come out, but the server warned us, which was nice. The Roquefort cheese on top was a nice touch - there was even a little too much of it, which is surprising, since I adore cheese. Also, the server wasn't shocked that I didn't want a bun and didn't screw up my order, like many places do when I order a burger. The fries were salty, crispy, and plentiful, so much so that I didn't finish them. I also might add that when we were seated originally, the waitress sat us side by side, which is not a good move. Luckily, they were nice enough to accomodate our request to move so that I was on the booth-ish side, with my friend on the opposite side in a chair. I saw another couple come in and get the same. If no one wants to sit that way, then maybe it's time to change your seating...",0

113128,1814,3.0,1,2011-04-11,"It's that time again, boys and girls. Time for another burger adventure with Amal. Not much new to report on The Spotted Pig, but I'll say it anyway. After sending my burger list to a buddy I hadn't seen in 6 months, he told me he wanted to come here. From where I live on the UES, it took 45 min to come here for a Sat. lunch, so this is kind of a one and done experience for me. First, the infamous wait. For a 1pm lunch, the place was packed, and we were told 40 min.  We figured it would give us plenty of time to catch up, so we CLEARLY sat at the restaurant bench outside the window. At the 40 min mark, we went in to check, and were told they called our name out the door 10 min ago. Yeah, okay. But they still gave us the very next table which we had to wait another 10 min for. We were seated along the bench by the window which had very low-set tables and stools, which is slightly awkward. Oh, and they seated us right next to a heatpipe! Blergh! Really, you set up a table next to a heatpipe?! We both came here for the burger. Their beer selection is decent, so my buddy got one (I approve since I MUST do burgers with either beer or coke), and I got a coke, which was miniscule. The burgers took over 30 to finally arrive, which was a little annoying. My first thought: good but overrated. The meat is excellent quality and was prepared medium to order, there's no doubt of that. While I do like my burgers seasoned with salt and pepper, this is one of the only ones I've had that was just TOO salty, as was the Roquefort cheese it was topped with. It was overpowering and distracting. Besides that, the burger was still good, and I loved the toasted brioche bun it was served on (probably helped soak up some of the saltiness). Also, while I don't mind lack of toppings and just enjoying the meat (yeah, I said that), as in Minetta Tavern, this burger could have helped from some. The fries, on the other hand, were great. Extremely thin-cut and topped with rosemary, some of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, my buddy and I both did note though that they are so thin and long that they are way too unwieldy. Overall, service was okay. We got our waters refilled once and the waitress checked up on us every now and then once the food (finally) arrived. Décor was pretty standard for an upscale gastro-pub, and as I mentioned, tables are kind of awkwardly low-set. I didn't get a chance to see their fancypants 2nd floor, which is supposedly the celeb haunt. Would I come back here? Given the combo of price, commute, wait, and the fact that I thought the burger was overrated, probably not. Though I am tempted to try burger at The Breslin, another restaurant by head chef, April Bloomfield, which has a slightly different burger and rumored phenomenal thrice-cooked fries.",0

125696,1814,4.0,1,2014-06-30,"Wow, this place is a tiny, crammed, wacky mess...and I love it.  Plastic pig lights strung across the wall, cheap old posters of veggies, the world's tiniest bar and the world's most overworked bartender, itty bitty tables so close to your neighbor that you could eat off your plate, and about an hour's wait even on a weekday evening.  And yet I still loved it.  The ambiance was effortlessly hip (as opposed to trying-too-hard hip), and the food was delicious. Chicken liver toast as an appetizer was yummy and a hearty portion (two slices per serving).  The nightingale cocktail was divine.  Five stars for the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi -- which are basically little round, plump raviolis -- and the divine butter sauce they serve those sitting in, omg.  An excellent dish to share if everyone at the table wants just a bite or two, which is more than enough given how rich they are (portion size is seven per plate). The burger was good (NOT the best everrrr, but really good -- juicy meat, buttery bun, oozing melted blue cheese).  I wonder what it would have tasted like without the blue (Roquefort) cheese...because it's an unusual cheese to put on a burger, and I wonder if some of the hype is just simply due to the novelty of that taste on a burger.  However, the meat patty itself definitely was very juicy and the bun was perfect, so I'll give the burger as a whole the benefit of the doubt.  The super skinny rosemary fries really made that burger dish sing.  I'd suggest ordering a side of the fries no matter what you get (as the table of four girls next to us did). Service was great -- unpretentious but polite, and appropriately attentive.  The hostess was particularly jolly, which kept me entertained while sitting at the bar waiting for a table.  (The bartender was not so jolly, but she was so darn overworked that I'll let it slide.) Not a five-star experience, mostly because it's a little overpriced for what you get, but a solid four stars.  Try to go on off-hours (if there are any), or come prepared to wait a while.",1

125974,1814,3.0,1,2011-09-08,"Honestly, I was expecting a little more.  For a place that is supposed to have the best burger in NYC, I wasn't exactly impressed.  It was decent, the cheese gave it a nice flavor, but eh.

68983,1814,4.0,1,2011-11-20,"Friday afternoon, around 1:30, the wait is only 20ish minutes. A stroll around the neighborhood, a necklace and pair of rain boots at Marc Jacobs later and it's already time to be seated. We're lead upstairs, into a little alcove of a room for no more than eight people. Our server is warm and friendly, as is everyone that helps him out. We order various teas and coffees so extra hands were necessary to swoop them all in at the same time. We shared a salad of sunchokes, sunflower seeds, escarole and a goat cheese (I think?). It was a normal plate but we decided on it for an appetizer and woah, it got us very excited for whatever was to come. Not only had we never tried sunchokes before, adding to the excitement, but the salad as a whole  was like none other. There was a lemony dressing with the cheese so soft and getting into ever delicious bite. My main might just be the best hamburger and fries I've ever had. How could I not order that after all of the hoopla I've heard? Arriving on a shiny grilled bun along with a whole haystack of shoestring fries, I knew I was in for something good. I'm still mesmerized by those fries! Deep-fried rosemary leaves are strewn throughout them, as well as slivers of garlic. Cut so thin, the fries were like potato chips- the best chips I've ever had. The burger tasted like a burger should taste- here's the beef! I ordered it medium rare and I could really taste the meat that was moist to the point that I don't know how it stayed together. Roquefort cheese took it over the edge. Not ketchup for this baby, but I added some mustard. This would be a five star review if not for the fact I feel I have to account the table's experience as well. My sister is a vegetarian and ordered the pumpkin soup. Like any other item on the menu, a list of ingredients follows the titles. She was home free; she said this was the best soup she'd ever tasted! But then she encountered a cube of pancetta and after finding this out, she had to send it away. Word to the veggies, ask questions! I still loved the atmosphere, loved the food and loved the time I had here. The Spotted Pig, new location in Toronto perhaps?",1

The fries are tasty, but kind of hard to eat since they're so fine. I also had a bowl of smoked cod chowder, and it was fantastic; a great cold weather soup. Moreover, I was seated right away and the service was great. I would definitely come here again. This is also one of the most affordable Michelin Star meals I've ever had at under $30 a person.",1

With all the reviews I've read from previous yelpers, the most complaint was the line to get inside. Obviously I did not want to wait, so what did I do? make a call in and order my burger to go!   The location of Spotted Pig is in West Village. A gastropub next door to many local residents. Since I didn't dine inside, I did not get a chance to experience the atmosphere only the burger. Roquefort Burger description- Medium rare burger, the texture was springy and moist. This was a very smooth tasting burger. However, this was only determined by eating parts of the burger not covered in the Roquefort cheese. The cheese overpowered the mild beef. The seasoning was appropriate to the mild flavors of the beef. The savory blend was applied as the patty cooked, and and it served to round out the mild flavors of the carefully constructed burger.

The mackerel was great as well, with a sweet potato puree on the side which was absolutely to die for.  I think the puree was better than the fish itself. My friend and I then split the burger...medium rare...WOW AHHMAZINGGG... seriously, I was so wildly impressed with this burger that I will be dragging my boyfriend back ASAP.  Yes, it's a $17 burger, however...being that great and delicious I will justify just the burger and a small glass of wine to top off the meal...  The french fries are shoestring and super fun to pop into your mouth.

We had the devilled eggs, the liver toast, the dates wrapped in bacon and the olives. The stand outs were the toast and the eggs. The vibe of this place was real upbeat, and you can tell everyone was enjoying their food. We had a lot to drink, but eventually had entrees. My girl had the skirt steak and I had the Sea Bass. Amazing flavors all over the place. Would love to go back again this year. I have nothing bad to say about this place. We loved it.",1
5574,1814,4.0,1,2013-07-25,"On a quest to find the best burger in NYC, my friend and I came here on a Monday night for dinner. We arrived at around 7:30 and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table due to their no reservations policy, so by the time we were seated, we were both more than ready for our burgers. We also decided to split two appetizers - the devils on horseback and the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto. The devils on horseback were dates and pears wrapped in bacon. They came piping hot, and when I bit into my first one, it was mushier than I expected because I hadn't realized there was also pear in it. They were pretty good, though I wish the bacon flavor had been a little stronger against the pear. Our second appetizer, the ricotta gnudi, was amazing. We had picked it after googling ""ricotta gnudi"" on our phones and deciding that it looked pretty good (though we weren't entirely sure what it was). Turns out it's very similar to ravioli... delicious, melt-in-your-mouth ravioli. Our appetizers came out quite fast, but we had to wait a little longer for our chargrilled burgers (or maybe it just seemed that way because we were so hungry/excited). Our plates finally arrived, each one with a giant burger and an even bigger pile of shoestring fries. Unfortunately for me, I didn't realize that Roquefort cheese, which came on the burger, is a type of blue cheese - and I hate blue cheese with a passion. Luckily it was easy to scrape off, and I transferred it onto my cheese-loving friend's burger before proceeding to enjoy the rest of my burger. The meat was super tender - I had ordered it medium, but the pinkness actually looked more like a medium rare. It was overall very yummy, and I was so full by the end that I couldn't even finish the last few bites. I also loved the shoestring fries - they were salted and seasoned nicely, and the ketchup that it came with had some kind of tanginess to it that tasted a bit like sriracha.

48665,1814,4.0,1,2012-06-19,"Went here on a quiet Thursday evening when my mom, her girlfriends, and their respective kids were visiting. Had been walking around all afternoon in the heat, Obama was in town so the visitors were frustrated by the lack of cabs, and we had just dealt with a slight shopping fiasco around the corner. Came across The Spotted Pig and I recalled that it was supposed to have delicious burgers. And beer. This was a no-brainer. Went in and were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait but that we could go upstairs to the other bar. Kind of frosted my cookies that there were plenty of open tables, but I digress. We all had a beer, then were seated right next to the bar - so close, in fact, that my mom's friend Mary couldn't get through the crowd with her purse. Once we all finally settled in however, and the food started coming, it was all good. My mom and I shared the burger with roquefort and shoestring fries. Oh Burger Jesus, the fries! I could have eaten my weight in them, and we all loved the shaved garlic and rosemary that had been fried right along with them. In the end, we ordered an extra serving, just to be on the safe side. Definitely want to come back here with my dad, but again, on a quiet(ish) night. It would seem that even on quiet nights, this place gets stuffed to the gills. Or would that be snout?",1
78325,1814,4.0,1,2010-10-30,"As we French say : in the Pig, everything is good! Nothing too original, but this is a place where you can have one of the best burger in NYC (with Roquefort). However, I found the fries (shoestrings as they call them there) kind of disappointing. All in all, this was a very good experience, with a feeling of being in a nice Parisian Brasserie.",1

Most everyone who came in for dinner had to wait 90 min, but I must say the woman at the desk was incredibly patient and very polite with everyone.   We had a great table, and the food was wonderful. But not so wonderful in terms of being so over priced.  The entrees are basically the meat or the fish with some beautifully prepared sauce. But if you want anything to side with it, you have to order that separately.  We ordered the bass, the skate, the skirt steak and the burger. The fries were so-so, the fish was terrific , the burger was kind of ordinary. However, except for the big pile of fries with the hamburger, the main dishes came with  a lot of bare dish i. At  $32,. No sides. They are extra at $8 apiece.   The portions are artfully  presented with wonderful sauces, but so small most of us  wound up eating a lot of bread - the olive oil served with the bread is amazing.  The ambiance is nice - little pigs everywhere, and the wait staff is friendly, and well trained.  But the noise level especially with the ceiling made of tin, and the pipes is so loud that it was very difficult to have a conversation. Thus the reason for the two stars  - basically that for each wonderful experience, there was a downside.  Tasty food, but small portions and way overpriced.  Friendly earthy sweet decoration, but terrible noise level, friendly well trained staff but because of the crowds, very over burdened.  I am glad I tried the Spotted Pig, but I won't be returning.",0

Quite small but I visited at lunchtime and was seated straight away. The tables are almost on top of one another. Didn't bother me as there was no one next to us but I would certainly have been uncomfortable if there had been. Service: Perfectly pitched. Drinks: I was pleasantly surprised with the wine list which was extensive for a pub. I enjoyed a glass for Rock Rabbit Sauvignon Blanc - very nice. Food: I had the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and it was the nicest grilled cheese I have ever eaten. It comes with caramelised onions and dijon mustard on the side but I ignored these. The sandwich was perfectly delicious as it was and I found myself savoring every bite. My fiance doesn't eat cheese so he had no option really but to go for the Burger. The lunch menu is big on cheese. He obviously ordered his san Roquefort and had it cooked medium. He described it as 'not quite as good as Minetta, not a patch on Five Guys but very good nonetheless'. It comes with shoestring fries. He thought they were ok but I wasn't a fan. They looked fantastic and the little bits of rosemary and garlic are a nice addition but there's just a whole lot of string and not much else. I found them borderline nasty as they began to get cold so get to them while they're hot. A lovely experience in a nice area. I will certainly be back for that Grilled Cheese perfection.",1

Almost rare, smeared with bleu cheese, served on a grilled brioche bun with shoestring fries, this single, simple entree that put The Spotted Pig on the map (okay, maybe Mario Batali put it on the map) earns its keep.

22103,1814,4.0,1,2011-08-24,"Heard this was a great place for a brew and a burger, so me and a few buddies decided to hit up the place. Its a very small British pub type of environment with low lighting, so it gets very crowded and cramped to seat in. Also, you can't make reservations which sucks if it gets too packed and you have to wait for an hour, especially on an empty stomach. But, its nice to kill time at the bar and try out some of their nice selections of beer. Their signature drinks are probably the cask beers, but note that these are served relatively warm, which may be unusual for beer drinks like myself. The Spotted Pig Ale was pretty good, but the other Cask option, the Six Point IPA, tasted like dirt. After getting seated, we decided to order the bar snacks as appetizers, such as the Chicken Liver Toast and Deviled Egg. The Chicken Liver Toast was very good and provided a good amount of chicken liver on each slice. The Deviled Egg was very average, although I personally like it since I'm an egg lover, the rest of the table found it mediocre and nothing special. We also ordered the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, which was pretty damn good as well, and was incredibly cheesy and flavorful, making it a highly recommended starter as well. Finally, the entire table ordered the Spotted Pig's Signature Roquefort Goat Cheese burger with Shoestring fries. As a fan of goat cheese, I definitely loved the burger, however it was a bit overwhelming on the burger which make it really salty. The burger itself was pretty juicy, although i should have ordered it medium instead of medium rare since it was more bloody than medium rare should be, so lesson learned. If ketchup is needed on a burger, its never a good sign. However, the fried was the redeeming part of the dish, and they give you a lot of fries with each order, and the fries was pretty good on its own without any ketchup or salt. Overall, it was a quite a good experience, and I would recommend trying it out once if you want a unique beer and burger experience. 4 out of 5!",1

14219,1814,2.0,1,2011-10-10,"Maybe I went on an off night, but my experience here was far from rave-worthy.  I actually can barely remember what I had here (never a good sign, since I'm food-obsessed and a catalog of eating experiences). I do remember some major disappointments, though: - the food was too salty.  all of it.  not in a, this-is-tasty-at-the-moment-but-I'll-be-thirsty-­later sort of way, but just unpleasantly salty.   - the food was over-priced.  all of it. as a stand-out example, a side of pickles was $6 (in my memory -- it might even have been $7).  it consisted of a few wan carrot sticks along with some other items, doused in salt and vinegar (and again, not in a good way).   - the space was way too crowded.  If you're paying $6 to eat pickles (and a lot more to actually eat your meal), it would be nice if inebriated people from the bar would not be practically falling over your table. I had a nice dinner but that was entirely a function of the company I was with, and almost nothing to do with the restaurant itself.  Based on my experience there, I have to wonder whether part of the positive reception of this restaurant is just response to hype.  There was recently an economics study performed where they demonstrated that people actually enjoy a bottle of wine more if it's priced higher than if the same bottle of wine is priced lower -- maybe that 'wishful thinking' effect is in operation here?",0
125835,1814,1.0,1,2013-03-22,"SNARKY, DIRTY, OVERPRICED. I had high hopes walking into this eclectic, hipster, high-end joint, with all the stellar reviews and what not. But, my party and i left quite disappointed with both the service and the food. The ambience was alright, if you don't mind sitting tight with whoever you came with (and perhaps even those you did not), as they will squeeze you in wherever, and as long as you do not mind pots of herbs in your hair (they have herbs growing in the window sill, which normally would be a nice touch, if only they were not scratching my neck the whole visit). I came early in the evening with two friends. The wait for a table was a good 30 minutes, during which time we were not offered a drink from the bar, but were greeted only with snarky stares by a number of the waiters. Once we were seated, we got to ordering quick, starting with the deviled-eggs. First mistake. The were completely overpowered with vinegar. We could not taste the egg yolks or the chives, only vinegar. I mentioned to the waitress that they did not taste good, only of vinegar, and she retorted, ""VInegar is one of the main ingredients,"" and did not offer to return them to the kitchen. Our mains were just okay. I ordered the fish and my friends ordered the vegetable platter and the burger. The vegetables were completely overpriced for the amount given and the flavor (somewhat bland), and so was everything else, due to the snarky staff, long wait, and tight seating. The kicker, too, is that at one point during our meal i got up to use the restroom. A male employee was in there, so i  waited a minute before i could get in. There are only two stalls, mind you, and the toilet in the stall i walked in was COVERED IN URINE. So, either that employee was pretending to clean up in there while in actuality doing nothing but killing time, or he is the one who urinated all over the toilet. Either way, no thank you. I honestly got the impression we were not wanted there. I will not recommend this place and will not be returning.",0

I finally was able to come in this past Saturday for brunch when a friend called me up asking to catch up.  I told her there may be an hour wait but she was game. We agreed to meet up at 1pm however, due to the jacked up subway lines on the weekend, I was 30 minutes late. As soon as I stepped off the subway, I ran towards Spotted Pig where I saw my friend waiting at the corner.  I asked if she already put her name down on the list but said she didn't. Oh well as we walked in and spoke with the hostess who told us luckily, the wait would be 10 minutes after writing my name down.  However, she decided there was actually a table upstairs and a gentleman led us up immediately.  PERFECT. Spotted Pig reminded me of those Old British pubs.  They didn't have mahagany paneling but dark magenta walls lined with tasteful British knick-knacks. I inadvertently made a comment stating, ""That's our table?"" when I saw a rather cramped looking round table against a booth and the gentleman quickly asked if this table was ok. My friend said it was fine as we were seated next to each other rather face to face. We immediately received our menus and had 2-3 different waiters attend to us. One taking our orders for our drinks and another one coming by later to ask about our order.  My friend really wanted pork but  didn't see any on the menu since it was still brunch. Our waiter sensed something was  amiss and quickly told us there were specials and both of our eyes lit up.  He first talked about the ground up pig's face wrapped up and served with duck's egg and lima beans.  There was a second special but that went out our ears. Both my friend and I chose that dish along with unsweetened ice tea and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The fresh squeeze orange juice was $5 and was served in an 8oz glass which was rather disappointing since I saw my friend's iced tea served with sugarcubes for $3 and in a much larger serving of 18oz (give or take). Our plates came and were surprised it didn't come with toast or some type of bread to soak up the duck egg.  I immediately sliced into the pork and the richness was not as overwhelming as I expected.  It was light and went down easy settling well whereas other pork dishes I've had settled uneasily for me. The duck egg was definitely different and I can't put my finger on how to describe the taste of the yolk but let's just say, I wanted to try it again to have  a better feel of the taste. Our waitstaff was very attentive with 2 -3 different men checking to make sure we had enough water and asked about our food.

21344,1814,2.0,1,2009-12-26,"Quite honestly, I know see why the fuss is about.  Maybe it's because April Bloomfield has become a rising star in the male dominated culinary arena.  I think this joint is better for hanging out, versus actually dining but maybe I'm just not so hot on the Gastropubs.  The place is REALLY noisy (almost like you need to shout to your neighbor across the way) on a Sunday night, which again makes it better for a bar scene vs. food. As for the bar snacks, I would say the Chicken Liver Toast was jamming-- seems that Bloomfield is good with this kind of whipped delight/bread combo (a la her Onion and Bone Marrow Soup at the Breslin), and the Deviled Eggs were good. Let's just say that I expected a way better overall dining experience for such a long wait.  Protip: come at 4:30 to sign up for the earliest dinner spot, and come no more than 4 people max- the wait time is still 30 minutes or so.   Anyway, I did enjoy the ambiance and the decor.  The atmosphere is grungy-- still trendy but sort of like an upscale hipster place.  The waiters are waltzing around in Def Leopard T shirts and they suck.  (It's true, baaad service. Our waiter was impatient with us, and didn't even bother to ask if we wanted dessert- hmpfh). Okay, so the best item seems to be the Burger. I know I'm sort of cheating in this Yelp review because *I* don't eat red meat, but I'll admit it looked pretty damn good.   The shoe string fries were way better on paper than in person though- they were so thin, it felt like eating...nothing.  I had the chorizo stuffed quail which was 1) a teeeeny tiny portion and 2) gross.  The chorizo was gritty and flavorless- and the quail had NO meat, just the bone!   It's also ridiculous to charge $17 for most of the salads, but that's just me. I've heard it's a better place for brunch.  When the desserts better than the dinner, you know it's a bad place.

Without the lettuce and tomatoes, its basically a heart attack in a bun. And that was exactly what it was, except it didn't taste good. I understand that if the burger doesn't have veggies, then the meat would have to make up for it. The patty was bland and dry. The sauce that was suppose to add a ZING to it was almost nonexistent. The burger itself fell apart too easily even without the lettuce and tomatoes. I had an incredibly hard time holding the whole thing together and just gave up towards the end and ate the fries.

Perhaps it's just a difference in taste buds, but I could not stand the taste of the strong cheese on that burger. I literally had to wipe the cheese off the burger patty just to consume it and even then, some residual cheese on the bun ruined the experience for me. It's very possible the majority of the reviews were written by people who love strong cheese...or people who have never set foot in amazing burger places like Ottomanelli's...;) Also, with no other toppings besides that horrendous cheese, $21 is ridiculous for one burger, ESPECIALLY if it lacks bacon! The shoestring fries...are properly named. The problem is, they're so thin, I could barely taste the flavor on them. Props for cooking the fries with real chunks of garlic, though. I did enjoy their deviled eggs and the chicken liver pate, however. I am sure their other appetizers are equally great...I am just disappointed that the burger that's been raved about is actually not a big deal at all.

I've been to SP on nights when I thought the people were amazing - authentic, fun, wordly, and not pretentious. I've been there other days and it looked like the Rusty Knot's prepsters threw up inside of it. So I'm tending to believe it is hit or miss. Like most everything in West Village that is popular or trendy or owned by a celebrity - avoid it on the weekend, go only on weekdays.  Unless you head for brunch - which can be great on the weekend. Steer clear of a Friday or Saturday during key going out hours and you will hopefully avoid all those fun characters sporting boat shoes and dropping Ivy League bomb left and right.",1

Some of the people there seemed like they thought as if they were really  elite. Reality check: your eating a hamburger, drinking a beer and wearing last seasons Tory Burch flats.

After biting into some swiss chard, our friend noticed something not quite right about his dish. Lo and behold, he spit out a piece of broken GLASS the size of a dime, followed by two more. After letting the waitress know and asking to speak to the manager, we sat at the table in disbelief for quite some time. We finally had to ask another server to get the manager, a second time. The waitress and ""manager"" who appeared to be halfway coherent, at best, didn't quite seem to understand the severity or the urgency of the issue. They kept mentioning that the ""woman in the kitchen"" who was in charge didn't know where the glass came from. I guess the ""woman in charge"" in the kitchen didn't feel the need to come up and apologize to the customers on who she just almost inflicted serious internal damage. No mention was even made of comping the meal until WE told THEM that we were done, not paying and leaving immediately. Mistakes happen, but the poor mis-management of the situation was unacceptable. Wouldn't recommend coming here on a date unless you're looking to end the night in the ER.",0

It was Friday night so when we arrive they told us it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait.  We walked around outside for a bit and came back in.  After about 30 minutes we were seated. I ordered quail stuffed with chorizo, goat cheese souffle, and a salad with Spanish almonds. DH ordered a huge burger with shoestring fries.  He also ate the appetizer Devils on horseback but I couldn't be convinced to try it.  He really liked them All night I told him he was missing out because my meal was SO good! I think drinks may have been expensive. DH had a beer and iced tea, and I had two rum and cokes. In total we spent about $100 on dinner.

We had heard it was a long wait, so we arrived 15 minutes before dinner service began.  Umm, yeah, the wait was 2 hours.  The great thing is you can leave your number and shop your way through the West Village while you wait.  By the time our phone call came we were good n' hungry, but it was so worth the wait! The AMAZING -Chicken Liver Toast - we had read amazing reviews of this so we had to try it.  Despite our skepticism, this was a unanimous favorite of the night.  It had a chicken salad texture rather than the paste I was expecting.  Served on toast, we just couldn't get enough! -Ricotta Gnuddi with Brown Butter and Sage - so freakin' good.  I've never had gnuddi so I have nothing to compare it to, which might be a good thing (for the other restaurants I mean).  Pillows of hot, soft, rich ricotta pan fried ever so gently with buttery love and served in a creamy butter sage white sauce, they were delectable! -Wild Striped Bass with Cauliflower and Hazelnuts - the fish was cooked to perfection and the cauliflower puree with hazelnuts were the perfect additions. -Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort - EVERYONE in the restaurant  (and on Yelp!) ordered the burger so we had to try it.  You have to LOVE bleu cheese, because the roquefort is STRONG.  Personally it disgusts me, but my friend really enjoyed it.  The shoestring fries were prepared with roasted slivers of garlic and thyme and were just delicious.  Even after we pronounced we were full, we just kept eating them. The OK -Duck Rillette - spread on toast, this was very interesting.  It tasted like pureed pot pie to me, and had a sweetness to it.  I can't say if I liked it or not, it was just interesting. -Buffalo Buratta with Kale Pesto and Prosciutto - this was ok but not a stand out.   -Deviled Eggs - these were just ok.  Beware, they're super vinegar-y if you don't like that sort of thing.",1

Good food.  But the moment we entered the door, I was shocked.  Hostess had her back to us for about 5 min on the phone - not even a hello - then the attitude of the staff, the whole time was just atrocious.  We waited for a table for 45 min - no worries... but we were by the waiter station and all we heard was the staff complaining about working, the customers and some tables being ""a nightmare"" etc....  food took forever coming out, not 1 mention of anything - sorry for the wait - nothing - as if we were lucky to be there.  I would think in this day and age of extremely competitive food scene, the vibe, which used to turn people on for just getting into a hot spot joint would have shifted to just good service.  At his other spots (lupa, babbo...etc.) its busy, long waits, but you are treated well, treated as  if the money and time you spend there are appreciated.  Not here - this staff would embarrass me as an owner. a total shame.  As we left, the hostess didn't even look at us, she was busy texting someone on her phone.",0

We had the pork tonnato and a salad ... a nice enough start. I had the burger and my friend had the cubano.  The first hint that it wouldn't be great was when I asked for some mayo for my burger.  The waitress told me sorry they can't give me any mayo because they don't want to serve jarred mayo and it's too much trouble to give people the home made stuff.  It wasn't that they didn't HAVE mayo, it just wasn't included in my *$17* burger.  Not even a dollop.  Well, it did come with one of our apps so I ended up having to save it on the dirty dish, guarding it till I got my entree. This could have been forgiven if the burger was TDF but sadly no.  It came with a scoop of blue cheese on top and that really pushed the salt limit over the top, even after I removed some of it.  The shoestring fries didn't add anything. A lot of texture but not much flavor unless you count the rosemary they toss in with the fries.  Oh but they did serve STORE BOUGHT ketchup with the fries (and not even Hunt's--it was Heinz) I honestly think the shakeshack burgers are better and even their frozen fries are more satisfying.  The cubano was very very good.  Dessert was not memorable.  I may come back and try some dinner to see what the fuss is about.  The total bill for the lunch came to  about $90 incl tip no alcohol. If this was a neighborhood place I would have been satisfied, but it was friggin hard to find, highly touted and pricey to boot so it should have been better.",0
125837,1814,2.0,1,2013-03-07,"Meh. Following a lovely walk on the Highline, I have gone to this place probably 7 or 8 times only to find out there was a 2+ hour wait and abruptly turned around and left. The last time I went (and literally the last time I will ever go) there was a 15 min wait, probably because we showed up at 3 PM on a Thursday - and there was a limited menu on top of that. So with that, the place is small and intimate - intimate in a good way? Not sure. Regardless, there is limited seating which probably makes for the ridiculous wait times. The wait and kitchen staff are continually rushing through the dining area to collect food from the basement storage, so be careful if you find yourself sitting in the line of fire of shuffling servers and busboys. Anyway, I came here for the burger and was pleasantly disappointed. It was lacking in some way. The cheese was very overpowering and I would venture to say took away from the burger itself. The french fry strings were next to impossible to eat if you want to maintain a sense of class. Granted you get a shit ton of fries, but they kind of just seemed to be there for show. Lots of rosemary for taste, but overall, not that impressive. The chicken liver toast was pretty goddamn awesome, and a healthy portion too. I recommend that. Fo sho. But the burger was just plain, well, plain. I've seen a couple reviews mentioning Jay-Z as a part owner - if you're coming here for that, god help you, you sheep. Don't waste your time. If you can get a seat right away, try it out. If you are presented with a wait time over 15 minutes I recommend anything else in the area - it's the village after all, there's plenty of kitschy restaurants that are just as good if not better.",0

So we tried: Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto Shoestring Fries Cubano Sandwich with Mixed Greens special: braised oxtail on bruschetta everything was delicious!!! well ok maybe not the cubano sandwich it didn't taste like anything special. but my absolute favorite was the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi and the oxtail special! it was delicious! it was nothing i have never tasted before! the oxtail was cooked to perfection and it was super soft.  and the ricotta was absolutely great with the sauce. you just have to try it yourself to see what i'm talking about. oh yeah the hardest part is getting a table during dinner. they called us literally two hours later...and by that time we already finished our dinner and dessert elsewhere and were already back at home in our pjs. so try getting there during lunch time during the week!,1

Just goes to show, kindness will go a long way :) It's a relatively small establishment, so it gets a wee tight. Although in my opinion, it was all part of the restaurant's charm.

We ordered the Deviled Eggs which I usually don't like but these were good. The Grilled Cheese Sandwich was unbelievable.  Just unreal how good it was with the onion marmalade and mustard on the side.  The Burger was very good.  We also ordered the Cuban Sandwich.  My wifey warned them of her Cuban nationality but it delivered... so she says...

22019,1814,5.0,1,2010-02-21,"Did I see anyone who more than 20% of the general public would deem important? No. Did I really enjoy the service (at the bar or at the table) supplied by those with inexplicably-sprouted hair and -located piercings? No. Did I love the food? Unequivocally yes. Had a drink at the bar during our estimated 40-minute wait for Sunday Brunch (felt like and possibly was ~25 minutes). Enjoyed a Spotted Pig Bitter And a Captain Lawrence while admiring surrounding fine swine. Once seated and the menu investigation commenced, the vegetation outside kept my attention for a significant portion of time and delayed said exploration. Eventually opted for the delived eggs, Artichoke Salad, Half A Frittata, the Ginger Cake And a Piece Of the Flourless Chocolate cake--everything was legen-wait for it...-dary. Nevertheless, the ""eclectic"" tunes were bumpin' as the ubiquitous grilled cheeses stared at me with ""ha ha"" eyes (nowhere near as good as grilled cheese bedroom eyes). Overall, The Spotted Pig provides a refreshingly egalitarian approach to good food and drink despite cramped quarters with faux big shots (ourselves not excluded). The correlation between bearded help and renowned eateries is a relationship that needs to be investigated (as well as the aloofness therein). Make no mistake, Dutch Babies will not escape my grasp next time.",1

There is a small bar downstairs but was told of another upstairs. There was a small crowd but I was able to grab a seat and order a drink and the burger. Bartender was friendly and chatted it up even with the fast pace of other people's requirements.  The burger came out and was cooked to the medium temp I requested! (Which is so refreshing considering so many burgers I've had cooked twice as done as preferred) the The shoestring fries looked good on the plate but I do prefer a heartier fry that doesn't disintegrate upon handling.

Some context: Let it be known, I am a huge fan of the Shake Shack Burger as well as a delicious, freshly grilled burger in a sit down restaurant like Corner Bistro.  Like those on NY Magazine's Food Editorial board, I am also keenly aware that the best burgers are 80% lean, accompanied by lettuce, tomato, some mild cheddar cheese, and sandwiched between a toasted potato bun and served with shoestring french fries. So, overall it isn't worth the wait for this burger.  The ambience is very nice, the staff is good as well. Perhaps it was the salt-loving chef who was working this Sunday (Feb 27 around 2pm) or  perhaps this is really their style.  Either way, I'm definitely not going back there for a burger, but I'd give some of the other items on the menu a try.   I'm up for 2nd chances.   Lastly, How can this place really be a michelin star restaurant?

However, if I eat too much of the burger I feel sickly. So, the solution is to split the burger with a friend with two, four, six grand glasses of rioja. Or their red hen beer, oh yeah. Unfortunately, through all my visits, a sick feeling washes over me and I can't bring myself to step in. So salty and rich. Even the salad is too salty! But the burger is still appealing to me.

The bread, though, was exquisite - rarely do you get burgers with bread that are this well grilled and hold up to a thick juicy patty like this one. The shoestring fries were delicious, filled with rosemary and garlic chips. Yummy! You also get a big mountain of them. The drinks were A-OK, although the waiter was not too helpful when I asked how ginger-y one of the drinks was (all he could say was that there was more hibiscus in the mix of the punch than ginger... which is not very helpful because ginger can pack a punch).

Also chicken liver toast is nutso good The burger is 21 dollars (when i first went it was 18, just keeps going up) but to be honest it is one of the best burgers anywhere. Furthermore they are open til 2am. yup thats right 2 am. With the dearth of restaurants in nyc of this caliber open this late, this is a welcome surprise. alcohol prices are pretty fair. Although food is a bit on the expensive side, but who cares, all the food is of top quality and ambience is also great, and while the food is a tad expensive for gastropub, it is anything but a ripoff. worth every penny.

If you're not claustrophobic, this place is well worth patronizing. It's pricey, definitely a splurge in my opinion, but the portions are perfect and the food is masterfully prepared and presented beautifully. The pumpkin soup with pancetta is to die for, seriously. I also had the prosciutto and ricotta tart with marjoram, the prosciutto was nice and soft- this was such a delicious and well balanced dish. it was savory, creamy, and the tart was pillowy and flaky. The grilled skirt steak was just OK- i found it bland, and for the price the portion was far too small. There literally was just enough steak to fill a taco with. Not cool. The sauteed spinach was good, but it wasn't enough to save the steak. I should have known better than to order something so simple after seeing so many good plates on my way to my table. The seared arctic char with cauliflower and hazelnuts was amazing. Well worth the price and a great compliment to the pumpkin soup. Tender, savory, and moist. YUM.",1

I just had oysters (not a lot for the none flesh eating types) and beets--salty amazingness.  My wife had the burger, which she couldn't stop talking about. The potted pickles were special.

I love the relaxed and casual ambiance of this place and I can't wait to come for dinner but I don't think I will come back to the bar. First the bartender took 23 minutes (I timed it) to actually acknowledge us. Then when she finally came to us, she gave us the biggest look of disgust I have ever seen. I mean I wish I snapped a picture of it. We all looked at each other and said we will have one drink and we will leave because that set a bad vibe with us.

The wait staff was very nice and helpfully explained some of the dishes for us.  We had a wonderful meal:  my daughter had the gnudi and I had the sausage (yes, the faggot with mashed potatoes).

We eventually decided to try our luck at the bar upstairs because we were told we could order food there. Elbow to elbow with not that many seats/tables. So we ended up having to eat our burgers standing up. The bus boys had to put our food on a stool, on the bar, and some people had to hold their plates (massively inconvenient). We were here primarily because we'd heard great things abut the burgers. The chargrilled burger was good and came with a ridiculous amount of shoestring fries. They put way too much roquefort cheese on it (enough to be overpowering), but other than that, it was a good burger. Maybe not $18 good. On the plus side, the bartender was great. She was very understanding of letting us split the bill in strange ways.",0

My friend and I went there for Saturday brunch and waited an hour to be seated (which I know is typical in NYC on the weekends but it shouldn't be for a place like this). When we were finally seated, we had to share the same side of a booth seat, which means that we had to sit sideways to make eye contact with one another. Actually, it doesn't seem they own chairs in the section we were in, as a family of four next to us had to share one booth seat also (wtf?). I know NYC is a cramped city but DAMN!  Aside from cramped seating, the place seemed really dark and dank, which is ok if you're at a pub or bar, not a restaurant serving brunch. The menu was less than mediocre, had like 6-7 options, and was overpriced.  I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakeS... Or so I thought. Actually, you just get one medium-sized pancake for $15, no sides, nothing. We had to ask for the bill several times and had to flag down the waiter every time we needed something (which was only twice) b/c he never came back to check on us. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, sorry!",0

The Burger was insane.  Med/Rare, juicy as all hell, wonderful bun and Roquefort cheese....I really had to force the last of it down I was so full and like a jerk I ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  Food Coma followed. The House Bitters was excellent as well as the Salty Dog and Dark and Stormy with housemade ginger beer.

I was trying to close my check at the bar to head to the table and ""Hipster A"" wouldn't move over an inch (after I politely asked him twice) so I could actually sign off my bill.

It's a large place--two floors, the lower floor with a bar and windows to let in plenty of sunlight, the higher floor more dark and woodsy and pub-sy (pub-ish? pub-y?).   Both floors were full during the few hours I spent here, and the space was warm and lively, not packed nor loud.  It's a nice spot to sit with friends.  We opted for a table upstairs but I think sitting at the bar would be fun here, especially if you're only a party of two. As for the food, I didn't love the offerings on the brunch menu overall, but what we got was solid: - The grilled cheese sandwich, made with three cheeses on the inside and, to my astonishment, a cheese on the outside.  Well done indeed.   - The dutch baby, which is a choice cut of a European child aged one to four, or maybe just a kind of a tasty pancake topped with bacon and dusted with sugar. Didn't try the renowned burger but I saw it all around, topped with hills of stringy fries.  Looked delish.  People seemed to enjoy putting in their mouths. Dessert is a no brainer: Banoffee pie. A British invention, it's a banana toffee pie and it must be ordered despite its ridiculous and ambiguous name.  (Ambiguous because, lacking any other context, it could be a banana coffee pie and... wait, why is that not a thing?  That sounds great.)   Things like this pie are one of the many reasons our stomachs are flexible.  Whatever you ate and drank beforehand, however you feel, however bad an idea it may be to order a dessert, just shut up and order it and then shove it in your mouth, safe in the knowledge that your stomach will almost certainly stretch to accommodate it.   Someday, perhaps someday soon, all hell's gonna break loose.  Political or environmental disaster will be upon us.  Cities will topple.  Land masses will flood.  Regimes will rise that will most certainly not be pie friendly.  And you--YOU!--will be left cold, scared, perhaps injured and perhaps alone, and you will stare out at the apocalypse around you and note the chemically and syrupy atmosphere, and your heart will sink with the recognition that on top of all the other things that are horrible, it is now also true that you are unlikely to ever again have the opportunity to eat this pie nor, indeed, any other pie.

We sat upstairs, I love the interior decorations of this place - makes it nice and homey. The food did take a while to come but they were very busy.

It really surprised me that an eatery this crowded can be so smooth (maybe I've just been going to the wrong places all this time). Service was never a problem, food came on time at well paced intervals in the appropriate order, and although it looked so crowded and cramped, things were well arranged so I still definitely had a lot of personal space. I didn't order the burger (GASP). The small plates looked more interesting so between a friend and I, we shared: the deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, seared fluke, speck, pork rillette, and the ricotta gnudi. The deviled eggs weren't anything special, needs more spice. Don't know what the hype is all about. The chicken liver toast on the other hand was the best dish of the night. Incredible flavors and texture. I'd go back just for that. Worst dish of the night was the seared fluke with creme fraiche and mint vinaigrette. Absolutely horrible. My friend told me last time he was here, it was mackerel instead of fluke and since he liked it so much, he wanted me to try it. But fluke is a much more delicate fish with more subtle flavors and the creme fraiche and strong mint flavors just really killed the light flavors of the fluke. Horrible horrible horrible. Really disrupted the otherwise nice dinner. The speck was normal (aka boring). Pork rillette and ricotta gnudi were both very interesting and flavorful but also a little too rich for my too used to Japanese food palette. Pretty big portions, for small plates. Creme caramel for dessert was delicious. Would come back next time to try the famous burger and have some more of that addictive chicken liver toast.",0

I wanted to split the burger and the cubano with a buddy, so we asked if the chef could cut the burger in half and HE REFUSED - what a douche!   Also the cubano completely sucked ass.  I didn't think you could screw up a cubano so bad.  It was over seasoned and there were NO PICKLES on it - instead they used some bland chopped green pepper.  The cheese was greasy, tasteless, and abundant.  Plus I'm not sure if they put the sandwich in a press - seemed like it was finished in an oven.  Either way, it was left in there way too long as the bread was hard and burnt. I can't deny the awesomeness of the cheeseburger .  This may be my new top cheeseburger in the city.  I'll need to try the burger a few more times for the novelty of the Roquefort cheese to wear off in order to make sure the burger really is that good. Burger comes with a towering side of shitstring, I mean shoeshit, I mean shoestring fries.  These were hard, dry, and completely underseasoned - perhaps not seasoned at all.  This was my first time dining here but the friends I was with said the quality of the fries has been slipping recently. Although this is possibly the best burger in town the place is overpriced and pretentious.  I want to rate it lower but have to give it 4* because a couple of the aps are too damn good and the burger w roq was ""lights out"" as Bonez would say.",1

After about twenty minutes the bar snacks arrived and were awesome. I could have eaten the chicken liver toast all night. That was the high point of the night. After another 45 minutes of waiting our waiter came by and assured us that our food was being plated at that moment, and it would be up in ""two minutes"". Fifteen minutes later it did come up. Sadly that was not the end of the problems. While the cider braised pork was very good but small, the polenta it was on was undercooked and very underseasoned.

27531,1814,5.0,1,2011-04-12,"I think I was so pleasantly surprised by the fantastic service, chicken liver toast, and hot mulled wine that it pretty much won me over even before my entree came out! I came here on a freezing cold day with a friend to celebrate a belated birthday lunch. There was still an hour wait at 2pm in the afternoon, so the host suggested heading upstairs to the bar for drinks and he'd come find us once a table was ready. One beer later (Six Points Crisp Lager - GOOD!), we landed a table downstairs ""nestled"" between all the other diners. Note: In actuality, the tables are so crammed together that you physically need to pull out the table in order for the person sitting in the booth to get in... but what's New York without a little space issue? We ordered the chicken liver toast based on word of mouth alone and it blew my mind! I've always hated liver for its texture and taste, but this gave me a new perspective entirely. Though it looks unappetizing (brown, kind of looks like wet dog food), its taste is phenomenal. We were both shocked at how good it was. We also ordered 2 mugs of the mulled wine after we figured out what was being ladled out by the hipster bartender, which is probably my favorite winter drink of all time now. The burger, which was the original reason we went, was good but I'm not a fan of Roquefort cheese. It seemed overpowering, even for my friend who liked cheese. The meat itself, pretzel bun, and shoestring fries were great though. The overall decor of the pub is eclectic, with a definite West Villagey feel to it. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and never made us feel rushed to leave. It might have been the buzz, but we left there 3 hours later extremely satisfied and happy!",1

Had the deviled egg app, it was good but nothing special. I had the burger which so many on here have raved about. It was the worst of the 3 entrees our group ordered. It was OK. Cooked too rare even though we ordered medium. Shoestring fries were a pain to eat, way too thin and couldn't dip in ketchup as they were too short as well. My friend's Cubano sandwich was much better. Pulled pork and cheese served with arugula, very good. The best thing to order here is the grilled cheese. It was awesome!!! All in all, a nice place but nothing great. Ignore all the hype for the burger and get the grilled cheese!!!",0
27416,1814,3.0,1,2013-06-17,"We were hungry and the unmarked door to spotted pig beckoned me.  Look for the small wooden spotted pig hanging from a small Ivey covered brick building. I had passed by early that morning and there was already a line for brunch, and the hoopla of April Bloomfields signless quaint restaurant appeared justified. The small place was packed but we scored a bar stool seat by a window opening to the street.  It was a great nook for two old friends to catch up over a bottle of wine. The oysters were brilliant (6 for 16) served with a pink vinegar sauce.   Service seemed astute to purchases, as the waitress seemed to drag out the delivery of our burger until we had finished our bottle and had ordered another glass. The burger was $20 and had blue cheese, it was good as you might imagine after having three glasses of wine.  Shoestring fries always frustrate me.  It's like disguising the sinfulness of the French fry, but without a lot of satisfaction, like eating air, or breadcrumbs. Spotted pig is a cute gastro pub with a small menu.   The menu seemed over priced and the dishes looked kind of boring, but we stuck to wine and ordered fairly successfully, more of a drinking place really with good snacks. This place reminds me of the Longman Eagle in Chicago. It's a casual Michelin star place, but while Longman is hipster Spotted Pig is pseudo pub with less of a value.",0

I got their burger and their shoestring fries.   Their rosemary fries were the best fries i've ever had [without sauces and dips].  Crispy, thin, and very flavorful. The burger, however was a different story.  The presentation was beautiful with gorgeous grills on the buns and a perfectly grilled burger.  However, the cheese on the burger made it a tad too salty.  Overall, it was still delicious, but difficult to get past the saltiness.  I'm pretty sure the execution was simply messed up a bit because the ingredients were all there and the combination was superb.",1
125682,1814,3.0,1,2014-07-27,Pretty unique menu.. the negatives : no customizations at all which was pretty difficult due to the uniqueness of the burgers. If you don't like what they have to offer you're pretty much SOL. What I did order happened to be very good. Very eco-friendly and hipster.,0

17870,1814,1.0,1,2011-08-03,"The first time I came here to the Spotted Pig was on a Friday evening with the boys. We had the turkey liver toast and the Roquefort burger with the shoestring fries. After being very confident about the meal here I brought a girl here on a Saturday morning. What a mistake - We waited for nearly an hour as it seemed like people who came in after us kept on cutting us in line and the staff was rude this time around. After having the amazing chicken liver toast and burger the first time, I thought it'd be natural to have the same. I don't know what changed in a span of 2 weeks but the chicken liver was absolute rank and smelled and tasted awful, the toast was burnt to a crisp. When I mentioned this to the waiter I was met with a disgusted look like the waitress had better things to do with his time and she firmly told me that's the way it's prepared and that's how it's always been. I informed her I had been there two weeks ago and it was great the first time. Then came our burgers, which I always order medium-rare, This burger was charred to a crisp, I could not believe how bad it was, that I refused to eat it. Once again, I spoke with the waitress and she claimed that I had ordered a Well-Done burger. Now that was just BS, my date and I were furious and I looked completely like a fool for recommending this establishment in the first place. To add insult to injury, the waitress seemed like she just wanted to keep the flow of people going. Honestly, I don't know how they would stay in business if this is how they treat customers and why would anyone want to come back.",0
126105,1814,4.0,1,2010-03-19,A college pub for discerning well-to-do adults.  Great wines and food.  An egalitarian if occasionally frustrating no-reservations door policy almost forces you to hang at the bar and make friends with strangers.  Go before 630pm or expect and hour or more wait; it's worth it.,1

The two were a little ugh but I did manage to eat it all.   I even met a wait staff that came out and introduce himself (Josh) as he was also from California.  I can't wait to get back here and try some of the other dishes and ales.

The deviled eggs are fabulous but the chicken liver toast is outstanding. So smooth and so tasty. The seasoning is perfect.  For entree, we ordered the 'cubano' with gruyere, and the chargrilled burger with roquefort. The cubano, although tasty, was not oustanding. It lacked something - je ne sais quoi. It was very one-dimensional. The burger however was outstanding, cooked to perefection, juicy, and very very decadent with the roquefort.

41412,1814,3.0,1,2013-02-08,"That was some good faggot! No, really. Fagoot apparently is sausage in the UK. OK, now onto my more adult review. Place was very cozy, warm and inviting. The waitstaff were VERY casual. Some on the border of dirty looking. I know it's a pub but at least look like you showered. They were all nice even the asian-ish latino guy who sat us down and gave us a military like speech ""You server will be with you soon"" in a soldier's tone. I was like, ""yes, sir! thank you sir!"" The food: We had the faggot (hehe), it was delicious, the cheese ball things, the dates wrapped in bacon, the brussels sprouts, the chicken liver toast and the mackeral. We were pretty satisfied. There were 3 of us and it was enough food. ""Gastropub"", meh. I mean I've been to the UK and I'm always surprised at getting really good home cooked meals at regular pubs. So the whole idea of paying more for ""gastropubs"" seems silly. The wine: eh, I thought it was OK. I looked around and saw more people drinking beer/cider. If I go back I'll have that.

The food was top drawer - shared a special starter, pork rillettes with toast which was excellent - but the main course was really exemplorary. Seared fish on sweet potato mash with pancetta; a really fabulous lunch, full of flavour and cooking of the highest order. Service was a little slow as the place filled up, hence the 4-star rather than 5-star but definitely a place to go for brunch or lunch if you're in the area.",1
126241,1814,3.0,1,2006-09-22,"OK. I have skimmed through the reviews below, and I do agree with most, but I am going to be the hard bastard yelper here and offer what I think is a better alternative for the price. However, I will first bore you with my review. You can always skip to the end for my alternative places to eat --- but you will miss the juicy bit! Had dinner at The Spotted Pig on Friday night, had no problems with needing to book. Arrived between 7:30 and 8pm, and was seated straight away; all be it the table was not the best. In terms of the 'venue', it's basically a bar that sells food.  The concept that it has followed from the UK seems to be intact, but with an American bias.  The UK concept is spruced up British pub that has kicked out the pissed locals smoking loads of fags crowing the bar, and replaced them with trendy people that want a somewhat more refined experience in the cosyness of a pub.  I should also say that the food at Gastro pubs is normally (and should be) local and organic and not fussed with; The Spotted Pig would appear to follow this formula.   For dinner we shared and shared.  To start we shared the pig's ear, yes pigs ear.  Now this starter was $14, which is a lot for a pig's ear, given that it is not a prime cut of meat, but you are paying for the thrill of trying pig's ear, or at least we were.  The pig's ear was cooked a la confit duck, and served with endive and tender rocket and a caper dressing.  The ear was actually quite nice, strong in flavor with the duck fat, but it was difficult to eat --- no good if you have any dodgy teeth!  Anyway it was fun (but not $14 worth --- an ear what, 5c, they give them to pets for free, right!) For main course we shared the burger with those fries and chard. All great.  Burger cooked as we asked, fries sport on and chard spot on --- all spot on and yummy. The cost for our simple meal with 2 beers and a couple of coffees 70$ plus tip. Now here's where I will offer two alternatives.   If you just want a burger and fries and are a bit thrifty with your cash (and are in the location) the Broome Street Bar does a top burger that rivals the burgers at The Spotted Pig, and the fries are good to.  A burger at the Broome is between 8$ and $9, with a side of fries that is more than enough for two for a few dollars.  So if you're already downtown and on a limited budget, consider Broome. My second reason for an alternative goes like this.  The most expensive main at The Pig was $32 dollars for scallops, that's a lot.  The least expensive apart from the burger was $24, still quite a lot,.  All starters are about $12 - $14 not cheap. This puts it in restaurant territory!  if you are out with friends and up for a couple of courses each and some wine, and in the fortunate position to order from any part of the menu, I would recommend The Tasting Rooms on Elizabeth Street. The tasting rooms has the same relaxed atmosphere, with waiting staff in denim, but has more space, not so noisy, and I bet the bills would add up to about the same -  may be a little more in The Tasting Rooms.  But for those extra few bucks, you get space, better food, and a better dinning experience.  However, if you get lured by those great cocktails and the fancy wine --- BOOM - grab that credit card as it's gone do some chin ups!. I don't want to put The Spotted Pig down, as I liked it, just over priced for the surrounding.  Do give it a go, the cooking and food is good, but I just think there is better value to be found in NYC.   I have rated it only three based on cost.  On food it would be an easy four.",0
126194,1814,4.0,1,2008-10-07,"Incredible ambience. Friendly, knowledgeable service. Nummers food. What's not to like? What I *loved* was the gnudi, which I'd never even heard of before, and which was so decadent it was an entree and dessert all in one. I'm not even going to try replicating this dish at home, because I'd only muff it up. Even the creamed spinach was far better than I'd ever had -- creamy, but not so much so that it was soggy or mushy, and containing a hint of some spice (cinnamon? nutmeg?) I couldn't quite put my finger on. I'm leaving off a star because of the limited number of vegetarian options and the lack of a red wine under $10.",1
39196,1814,5.0,1,2014-07-04,"We ended up here with no reservations late Friday night, but I have to say the long wait was worth it. We grabbed some stellar Bloody Mary's at the bar and went out side on the bench and people watched. The location is eclectic, cramped and full of character. They were slammed. We finally were seated upstairs after an hour or so. Server was busy so service was a bit slow. We had drinks in hand and each ordered a different salad. The roasted carrot salad with avocado and orange was probably one of the best salads of my life. The roasted carrots were just perfect. Huge chunks of avocado and juicy oranges with the perfect amount of the vinaigrette, which was to die for. Fresh herbs made this simple salad a masterpiece. My friend's bibb lettuce salad was just ok. Mine was the star of the show. Just wow. Order it. We split the deviled eggs which were good, but had a weird celery-tasting liquid on it. Wasn't crazy about these. We split their famous burger and yes, it was completely worth $21. It was a huge burger with the perfect ratio of meat to bun. Roquefort on top of the juicy meat was just to die for. Seriously another amazing dish. Shoestring fries with fresh rosemary. OMG those fries. We were too full for dessert, but this is a must-try if in the city.",1
70650,1814,5.0,-1,2014-12-27,"So glad I found this place! The Spotted Pig is an awesome place to spend your evening. They don't take reservations (which in some ways is nice, you don't have to plan far in advance to come here). The kitchen opens for dinner around 5 or 5:30, so that's when my group got there to put our names down for a table. We were seated by around 6:15 or so. In the meantime we enjoyed some drinks at their bar. The menu changes every day, so they really think through their menu. We had their chicken liver on toast, squid soup (more squid than soup), crispy pig ear salad, seared mackerel with sweet potato mash & house cured pancetta, grilled skirt steak with delicata squash, hazelnuts, and yogurt dressing, and wild striped bass with roasted cauliflower. They err on the ""rare"" side of medium-rare, just FYI. Our waitress let us know this beforehand, so we ordered the steak medium and it ended up being what we considered medium-rare. Everything was amazing, well-prepared, fresh, good service, etc. The Spotted pig is laid back, cozy, and very welcoming. I look forward to coming back again!",1

We opted to sit at the bar (first seats that opened up) had the Roll Mops (pickled herring) and Devils on Horseback (prunes wrapped in bacon with a spicy surprise) for appetizers. Both were off the charts. Had the pan seared bass and braised lamb shank for dinner and we pretty much licked the plates clean.

12606,1814,5.0,1,2008-02-02,"I have had dinner here twice, both times on casual first dates. So what does this have to do with it being, in my opinion, a five-star restaurant? There are many reasons why this place delivers. First, the location is in a part of the city that most of us see as being very cool or hip. It is a walking neighborhood, great for walking before or after dinner. The restaurant is famous, so the expectations are already there. It is, what I like to call, a memorabilia type bar; you know the ones that have walls covered with every kind of eye candy imaginable, great for getting conversations started even for the dimmest of minds. The place has been packed both times I have been there and we waited, not too long, but had enough time for a drink. I have been seated upstairs on both meals and the feel doesn't change much. We had started to look at the menu while waiting, placed our order and the culinary experience began. Joanne and I tried a a couple of bar snacks, plates, entrees and sides. We shared everything: just right for two with drinks. Seasoned well, constructed flavors and textures, presentation beautiful, the culinary experience is truly great. I'm a beer guy but they have full service bar and wines. The style is relaxed, perfect for those casual moments to grab a bite to eat on the fly. Expect it to be crowded, it is popular and the food is great. A good value for your dollar but not cheap eats.

7036,1814,3.0,1,2011-04-06,"Ok so I just got back here from lunch. I've wanted to come here for a while since I read that The Spotted Pig had a coveted Michelin Star, so a few co-workers and I hopped on the 1 train to go check it out. My first impression upon arrival is how unassuming the place is. Blink and you'll walk right past it. My co-worker remarked, ""if I didn't know, I would've thought this place was a florist shop."" (it is indeed flanked by shrubs and flowers and foliage.) We went inside and it did open up nicely. You can tell that they don't take themselves TOO seriously when it comes to ambiance and decor. The hostess was incredibly nice and we were seated upstairs within minutes. Service was good as we had a waitress and an ""associate-waiter."" (they kind of alternated helping us; filling our water, clearing our plates, etc, etc). I started off with the chicken liver toast which was very good. I ordered the burger with shoestring fries. The burger was cooked nicely (medium, like I asked), but I wasn't a fan of the roquefort cheese. I would've preferred almost ANY other cheese. The bun was nice and buttery. I was NOT a fan of the shoestring fries however. They WERE tasty, and cooked nicely, but they were SO THIN that they are actually hard to eat, and the amount of work it takes to get them into your mouth isn't worth the payoff when you get them there. I was seriously underwhelmed with my lunch entree. Another knock is that it took a LONG time to get the food. I understand that you need time to cook things right but it seemed like an inordinate amount of time for 2 medium rare steaks, a medium burger and some braised oxtail. I would LOVE to go back and give dinner a try, or at the very least go for lunch but try something else. My co-workers got the flank steak, beets and greens, and the ox-tail, both of which looked delicious and came with happy reviews. For dessert we all split the ginger, walnut and amaretto cake (one of our party is allergic to chocolate so we couldn't get the flourless chocolate cake like we wanted!) and it was good, yet very much like a carrot cake. Its a shame because I LOOOOOOVE carrot cake, so this seemed like carrot cake with something missing. *sigh* I SO wanted to love this place. And seriously, like a battered wife, I think that maybe I'M to blame for picking the food I chose. But as a review, I just can't HIGHLY recommend it to anyone else. Chicken liver toast, ambiance and service were above par, the burger and shoestrings below. All told, it was about $25 before tip.",0

If it's busy sit at the bar. If you're choosing between healthy and less healthy definitely go for less healthy; you can't go wrong.,1

This is a great place to go for a very casual but terrific meal - even better if you're cold and need something to make you warm! The burger is delicious, and I don't find the bleu cheese too overpowering at all. The fries that come with the burger are awesome, thin and herby and just delicious. Devils on Horseback are sticky and bacony and addictive, and the gnudi....the gnudi are worth going for alone. I've had gnudi at other places and they just do not compare - the gnudi are fluffy, creamy, pillowy...they kick gnocchi's ass. Chicken liver toast is nice....and the Banoffee pie is a great way to end the meal.",1
