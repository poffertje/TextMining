Now let's get down to all the other nonsense.  The burger was beyond mediocre and covered in salt. Basically everything was covered in salt. The burger, the fries, the pork belly, the bean purée, the chard, the potatoes appetizer. Every last one was soaked with salt. There were four of us eatting and no one could even finish or get 1/2 way through their meal because of the salt. The burgers were supposed to be cooked medium and they were basically raw. My stomach is still upset at me for that and I only had two bites. I will NEVER go back nor recommend this giant salt cellar. At least they took two of the four entrees off the bill. I never complain nor ask for things to be taken off my bill. But this meal was so repulsive that they needed to know how bad it was. They also offered a free dessert but we declined. The damage was already done and we didn't need anymore trauma.",0

Also, the pumpkin salad (special) was absolutely incredible! Not a lot of room to enjoy your food, but well worth making the trip, just to enjoy their burger!",1

April Bloomfield, the chef, was in that night, and my selfish heart secretly said she did that just to impress me. And oh yea was I impressed!! It was sticky delicious and melted in my ?! Everyone had the burger, and yes, one must have the burger. I had the calf's liver and then I wanted to cry again. I really really really hope she'll never take that off the menu. I will go back again and again and cry each time, until I have had everything on the menu!",1

The burger was absolutely tasty and filling and I am glad I decided to split the burger with a friend. Since I went with a group of five, we arrived early at 7 pm for dinner and had to wait about 30-35 minutes to be seated. I ordered a cocktail - the Salty Pig - and was a bit underwhelmed. I was expecting to taste a bit more of the mix of the salty and the sour/sweet of grapefrruit, but it tasted a bit watered down. The place is small, adding an intimate vibe, which is great for hanging out with friends and being able to have conversations without having to yell over loud patrons or music. I look forward to dining there again.",1
16036,1814,3.0,1,2009-01-24,"I am going to deviate a bit from the populist view of SP and give it an average rating. For anyone who doesn't like crowded noisy places, this place is not for you. For those who think you can grab a quick bite because you're  pressed for time, forget about this place completely and go somewhere else. The average wait for a table for 4 is 2 hours. Yes, 2 hours. The only way around this is to arrive before 5:30 and then put your name on the list at precisely 5:30 and then get seated shortly thereafter. Any other time, you'll have to wait and wait and wait. If you're with good friends and have lots to catch up on, not a problem. The catch though, is that they have a bar where you can get liquored up for those two hours and therefore blow a bunch on alcohol before you even order. And then by the time you order, you're drunk and so you're more apt to exercise less restraint and order expensive items. Brilliant! The owners deliberately lower your expectations of food as it's billed as British pub fare (ie: fish 'n chips, shepard's pie), but when you charge pretty much full-restaurant prices, I expect full-restaurant service and quality. Once seated, the service was quite good, though being seated right near the entrance, sitting on a stool and getting purses, jackets and elbows in my back all evening wasn't pleasant. I guess this is all part of the charm. Foodwise, everything was pretty tasty. We shared a few appy's, including the sweetbreads (be brave, they're good!), the gnudi (ricotta filled dumplings) and the prosciutto tart. We're off to a good start. Two of us had the burger w/blue cheese - an interesting combo - one had the striped bass and I tried the quail. I would say they were all fairly tasty but quite salty. I wouldn't normally put that much salt on my food, but I suppose it's their way to get you to order more drinks. I'd say there is a strong novelty factor at this place so it's worth a visit. But then again, there are other places that don't make you wait 2 hours to eat a $17 burger after you've spent $30 on drinks at the bar.",0

She doesn't usually do that on 30 minute meals but I had DH look up the restaurants and we decided on going to Spotted Pig. It was the best dinner I've ever eaten. It was Friday night so when we arrive they told us it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait.  We walked around outside for a bit and came back in.  After about 30 minutes we were seated. I ordered quail stuffed with chorizo, goat cheese souffle, and a salad with Spanish almonds. DH ordered a huge burger with shoestring fries.  He also ate the appetizer Devils on horseback but I couldn't be convinced to try it.  He really liked them All night I told him he was missing out because my meal was SO good! I think drinks may have been expensive. DH had a beer and iced tea, and I had two rum and cokes. In total we spent about $100 on dinner. The waitress was very nice in finding out what nuts were on my plate and giving me the Spanish name when I told her I wanted to write about my meal in my food blog :)",1

We did not have a reservation and waited about an hour for our table. The wait was not bad as there is a large bar on the first floor and we hung out and had a few drinks.

So don't kill me for not knowing anything about the food here! I will say that it is quite a scene. 2 minutes after my arrival, I was clinking glasses with with a group that included high profile actors, a huge Hollywood director, an up and coming fashion designer and assorted downtown characters like Lady Bunny. Everyone was laid back and fun - it really feels like you're hanging out in a comfortable pub in London. Next time I'll make sure to go before dinner!",1
21887,1814,2.0,1,2010-01-19,"Sorry to be the voice of dissent here, but I just thought this place was extremely overrated.  The wait time was  You wait and wait outside (since there's no place inside) only to be stuffed in a booth and served average food that's a little too greasy and burgers that are like slabs of salty raw beef (even if you get it well done).  This is definitely a neighborhood joint to ""be seen""...Katherine Keener was there on the night I went.  The staff was a little cold and I felt like I was at an exclusive club the whole time.  For a much better experience and amazing burger, I'd hoof it over to Dumont Restaurant in Wburg.  Totally worth the trek to Hipsterville.",0

125329,1814,2.0,-1,2012-04-06,"We made sure to get on the wait list at 5pm Wed for a table at 8:30 that same night.   We were lucky we had to wait only 20 minutes. . Most everyone who came in for dinner had to wait 90 min, but I must say the woman at the desk was incredibly patient and very polite with everyone.   We had a great table, and the food was wonderful. But not so wonderful in terms of being so over priced.  The entrees are basically the meat or the fish with some beautifully prepared sauce. But if you want anything to side with it, you have to order that separately.  We ordered the bass, the skate, the skirt steak and the burger. The fries were so-so, the fish was terrific , the burger was kind of ordinary. However, except for the big pile of fries with the hamburger, the main dishes came with  a lot of bare dish i. At  $32,. No sides. They are extra at $8 apiece.   The portions are artfully  presented with wonderful sauces, but so small most of us  wound up eating a lot of bread - the olive oil served with the bread is amazing.  The ambiance is nice - little pigs everywhere, and the wait staff is friendly, and well trained.  But the noise level especially with the ceiling made of tin, and the pipes is so loud that it was very difficult to have a conversation. Thus the reason for the two stars  - basically that for each wonderful experience, there was a downside.  Tasty food, but small portions and way overpriced.  Friendly earthy sweet decoration, but terrible noise level, friendly well trained staff but because of the crowds, very over burdened.  I am glad I tried the Spotted Pig, but I won't be returning.",0

At times the flavors are almost too rich as it seems to be with every dish in this place often bordering on too salty when earn together. The gnocchi plate is among the best offerings here tasting very smooth and buttery and the chicken liver toast is also a delightful dish. The seating is a bit cramped but the atmosphere is definitely very hip and I saw Anja Rubik dining upstairs so don't be surprised to see supermodels dining here. It was packed even on a Monday night.

Deviled Eggs - They look ordinary enough, but after you take your first bite, you can tell they have something a little extra, I'm thinking maybe olive oil? I'm probably totally off LOL Chicken Liver Toast - I could subsist on this alone.  It was so rich and creamy, the toast was toasted to perfection.  This was pure 't enough words in the world to describe it. Crispy Pig's Ear with Lemon, Capers & Trevise - Oh , but I couldn't help myself.  The ears were cooked to perfection.  If not done properly, pig's ears can turn out very tough to eat and not tender at all.  Obviously, they knew what they were doing. Seared Squid with Cilantro Butter & Fennel - What a surprise it was to get a little spicy kick at the end of first bite.  But absolutely a good surprise.  This dish was full of flavor, the squid was 't need ketchup, ranch, 1000 Island, whatever you normally use.

We waited another 10-15 minutes to be called and I tried not to panic (I hate the feeling of always being in an active walkway).  They took us upstairs and it was just as packed as the downstairs.  They showed us to our table and I noticed that most people sat on the same side of the table (I felt like I would have had to dislocate my shoulder like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon just to fit on the same side).  I requested a seat and they brought out a , a stool.  To me, nothing is worse than constantly fixing your posture because your back is able to collapse on itself.

The burger was absolutely AWESOME with the roquefort (I thought the cheese was good, but can be on the strong side for people that usually just get American/Cheddar). The shoestring fries tasted very similar to the marcona almonds with rosemary that you can find at Trader Joe's (maybe because the shoestring fries were fried WITH rosemary). The cubano 've had since Potbelly's (a chain from the midwest - if you're ever in the Chicago area, you HAVE to get an Italian with hot )! Actually, I take that back since Mary's Fish Camp AND the Pearl Oyster bar have awesome lobster rolls/sandwiches. Anyway, the cubano sandwich had pulled pork, pickles, grilled cheese, all put on a crusty piece of french bread. It was AMAZING! The arugula salad was lightly dressed with a lemony dressing (also great).  Our waiter was ?  Well, not 't want to be rude, but he was the type that's in his own world at times.  If I had to compare him to anyone from television, I'd compare him to Phoebe Buffet from Friends.  You know, sometimes they're just not all there?   The Spotted Pig is a great place for lunch (if Bill Clinton eats there, you should, too!) and I would go there all the time if the food wasn't so likely to give me a premature heart attack.",1

The toast was good, but I thought it was lacking some flavor. The calf's liver was actually the first time I had liver cooked so that the middle was rare.

It tasted like any burger you could get at a diner, random hole in the whole restaurant, etc. In my opinion, not worth the price and not worth the typical hour wait for brunch.",0
126241,1814,3.0,1,2006-09-22,"OK. I have skimmed through the reviews below, and I do agree with most, but I am going to be the hard bastard yelper here and offer what I think is a better alternative for the price. However, I will first bore you with my review. You can always skip to the end for my alternative places to eat --- but you will miss the juicy bit! Had dinner at The Spotted Pig on Friday night, had no problems with needing to book. Arrived between 7:30 and 8pm, and was seated straight away; all be it the table was not the best. In terms of the 'venue', it's basically a bar that sells food.  The concept that it has followed from the UK seems to be intact, but with an American bias.  The UK concept is spruced up British pub that has kicked out the pissed locals smoking loads of fags crowing the bar, and replaced them with trendy people that want a somewhat more refined experience in the cosyness of a pub.  I should also say that the food at Gastro pubs is normally (and should be) local and organic and not fussed with; The Spotted Pig would appear to follow this formula.   For dinner we shared and shared.  To start we shared the pig's ear, yes pigs ear.  Now this starter was $14, which is a lot for a pig's ear, given that it is not a prime cut of meat, but you are paying for the thrill of trying pig's ear, or at least we were.  The pig's ear was cooked a la confit duck, and served with endive and tender rocket and a caper dressing.  The ear was actually quite nice, strong in flavor with the duck fat, but it was difficult to eat --- no good if you have any dodgy teeth!  Anyway it was fun (but not $14 worth --- an ear what, 5c, they give them to pets for free, right!) For main course we shared the burger with those fries and chard. All great.  Burger cooked as we asked, fries sport on and chard spot on --- all spot on and yummy. The cost for our simple meal with 2 beers and a couple of coffees 70$ plus tip. Now here's where I will offer two alternatives.   If you just want a burger and fries and are a bit thrifty with your cash (and are in the location) the Broome Street Bar does a top burger that rivals the burgers at The Spotted Pig, and the fries are good to.  A burger at the Broome is between 8$ and $9, with a side of fries that is more than enough for two for a few dollars.  So if you're already downtown and on a limited budget, consider Broome. My second reason for an alternative goes like this.  The most expensive main at The Pig was $32 dollars for scallops, that's a lot.  The least expensive apart from the burger was $24, still quite a lot,.  All starters are about $12 - $14 not cheap. This puts it in restaurant territory!  if you are out with friends and up for a couple of courses each and some wine, and in the fortunate position to order from any part of the menu, I would recommend The Tasting Rooms on Elizabeth Street. The tasting rooms has the same relaxed atmosphere, with waiting staff in denim, but has more space, not so noisy, and I bet the bills would add up to about the same -  may be a little more in The Tasting Rooms.  But for those extra few bucks, you get space, better food, and a better dinning experience.  However, if you get lured by those great cocktails and the fancy wine --- BOOM - grab that credit card as it's gone do some chin ups!. I don't want to put The Spotted Pig down, as I liked it, just over priced for the surrounding.  Do give it a go, the cooking and food is good, but I just think there is better value to be found in NYC.   I have rated it only three based on cost.  On food it would be an easy four.",0

It may be off putting for some people to order a cocktail that isn't made with vodka or tequila and loaded with simple syrup or other sweet fillers. No no.

The 3 of us had a swell time.  We ordered 1 or 2 bottles of wine, 2 orders of gnudi, 1 burger, 1 flourless chocolate cake, 1 creme caramel, 1 tea, and 2 coffees.  All of the food was divine, and the total came out to about $100 -- not bad at all.

8817,1814,3.0,1,2011-10-13,"The gastropub concept took off in London a decade ago where pub patrons have long lamented the lack of good food to accompany their mugs of hearty ale. New York has finally caught on in recent years but Spotted Pig is the undeniable pioneer. Spotted Pig has been open since 2004 and yet on a Friday night throngs of hungry and thirsty New Yorkers still descend upon this West Village spot. The 100-seat restaurant has kept its no reservations policy so be prepared for a wait. On busy nights that can be an hour at the least.   Chef April Bloomfield came recommended by Jamie Oliver and her simple yet memorably delicious dishes does not disappoint. Since you most likely would have downed two alcoholic beverages by the time you get seated start with the chicken liver toast. It's a savory sweet combination that will both satisfy and rev up your appetite. Then have the Pig's twist on a British classic, Devils on Horseback. Bloomfield's version has them soaking the prunes in tea and stuffed with pickled pear before it is wrapped in bacon and cooked with a dash of cayenne. Yes, it is make your mouth water kind of delicious. Also a must try is the gnudi. The ricotta dumplings are rich with butter, Parmesan, and sage but still light in texture. For more substantial entrees there is the burger with Roquefort cheese, steak, and the squid if you want something a little more different. The dishes leaned towards salty but if you think about it, these dishes are essentially bar food and what better way to encourage drinking than salty food. There's a good selection of both beer and wine but the seasonal cocktails are also good to try. For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is satisfyingly rich and the seasonal fruit tarts are excellent. On a recent visit it was a peach tart topped with an exquisite lemon verbena ice cream. Now, while the meal was quite enjoyable there is an argument to be made that it is also overpriced. Put simply, it is dressed up bar fare, simple dishes that are executed well. So whether or not your tab at the end of the night is justifiable, especially with the hour long wait, is a question left up to each diner.",0
15749,1814,5.0,1,2011-12-08,"Oh Spotted Pig, how I love you so! Great spot for drinks! A lot of the classics done right. Gastropub atmosphere has a warm and inviting feel to it. Snagging a spot at the bar can be tough though and the area around the bar is a bit tight. If you're camped out there for a while be prepared to slllliiiiddde to the left and sllliiiidddeee to the right as waiters/waitresses push past you. This is a perfect anytime spot. Friends in from out of town? check. Hot date? check (a lot of the tables you get to sit next to eachother and get cozy not shout across a table and overhear everyone's dates going on around you - this is a major +1 on the dating front). Birthday gathering? check. Catching up with close peeps? well, you get the picture. However, they don't take resies so be prepared to wait and I'd suggest taking a large crew elsewhere. Food is great too! The Burger (everyone else has already commented) is great with the shoestring fries (a major food +1 - heaping piles of tasty fries). Devils on Horseback are a-maz-ing and deviled eggs are fab as well. I've had the striped bass and it was good but the burger is better. Service is good, everyone is very friendly.

I had never had thinner fries, nor one that is more flavourful. They serve it will a healthy dose of rosemary, and you literary smell the rosemary when they bring out plates of the fries. Heavenly!

I have no idea how many calories are in them (guessing close to a million) but you've probably left those kinds of concerns at the door when you go to the Spotted Pig. I agree with what everyone is saying about the wait ! I'm not surprised at all with the wait. More important to me is that they actually tell you what the time is going to be and they seem to be pretty accurate. On top of that, they could be nose-in-the-air snobs and get away with it but they don't! Really impressed with that. So why am I stripping them of two stars? Their famous burger is, quite frankly, crap. The meat was beautiful but they loaded it up with blue cheese until you could barely taste it. Having blue cheese on a burger is great but its like saying having sugar in your coffee is great - it doesn't mean you want 10 cubes. The second star - can we just distribute note pads to the city's wait staff? Our waitress was really cool but she didn't write anything down and if you can memorize 3 dishes, I really don't care.

Therefore I ordered the burger with Roquefort cheese. In short, it was an amazing culinary creation. It was one goddamn perfect burger. The ingredients consisted of only two things: Roquefort cheese and the beef , savory cheese added a great layer of flavor to the perfectly cooked, half-inch patty. And when I say it was perfectly cooked, it was goddamn perfect and they didn't even ask me how I wanted it cooked. They just knew that it should be cooked medium-rare/medium and there was no other way. The shoestring fries that came alongside the burger is also worth mentioning. Although I like thicker-cut fries, I didn't mind these.. especially since they were accented with rosemary and garlic chips. I'm drooling right, back in my home in SF thinking about that damn burger.

I had always wanted to eat at The Spotted Pig, but timing or fear of being let down had kept me , brothers, and my husband, and I think that we were all truly blown away. I was expecting it to be sub-par; I simply didn't believe that a restaurant could live up to all the hype that surrounds The Spotted Pig, but it really, really did. We had the crispy pigs ears, which were everything I expected; light, airy, and perfectly crisp, followed by pig cheeks and devils on horseback (which I have since recreated at home and want to go back to try at the restaurant again), which were both full of flavor and unique. We carried on with the famous burger stuffed with bleu cheese and served with a more than generous helping of shoestring fries, along with the ricotta gnudi, which I had never had before and am now a devout fan of; pillowy pasta stuffed with fresh herbs and creamy ricotta cheese? Yes, thank you very much. We actually ordered seconds of the gnudi, it was so delicious. We also had one of their seasonal salads, which was perfect as a light side to all of the other heavy dishes. The draft beers were great, as was the wine selection. Our server was a little on the arrogant side, but I was so happy with the food that it didn't bother me in the least. I can't wait for Ms. Bloomfield's cookbook to come out next month so that I can try some more of her recipes for myself!",1

This is the place that they stop to get a burger, which turns out to be an excellent choice on Karen's part. This is one of the best burgers I've had in a long. Great beef, delicious cheese, toasted buns and a heaping of skinny fries. Everything goes together great and is very complimentary. There may be a little issue with the wait but there are 2 floors and it's worth a bit of a delay to get a meal here.",1
25482,1814,4.0,1,2012-05-09,"Went to The Spotted Pig last night to celebrate the bf's new job.  We had to wait about an hour for a table (got seated around 8:30 on a Tuesday night), but they took our number and called us when the table was ready so we could go have a drink around the corner. The downstairs is a bit crowded, as in, you'd better pee before you're seated or else you're going to have to move your table to get up crowded, but it's dark and just loud enough to have a buzz in the air without prohibiting conversation.  Upstairs, where I went to the bathroom because I didn't realize there was one downstairs, was a little roomier and a little brighter. We shared the buffalo burrata as an app, and while it might have been one of the smallest things I've eaten for $17, it was AMAZING.  Creamy, salty cheese, sweet roasted peppers, and some salty, buttery toast.  One of the best cheeses I've ever had.  I had the gnudi as my meal, and it was a good size for me, though I am not one for huge portions.  It was SO DELICIOUS.  I love brown butter sauce, and this did not disappoint.  The gnudi were salty and creamy and unique.  There might've been six or seven of them, and though I wasn't stuffed when I was done, having shared an app I was satisfied, and I definitely wouldn't have wanted more of them, as they were very rich. My bf had the deviled eggs, which he loved and said were a steal for $4.  He got the burger, which he said was outstanding, and I shared some of his shoestring fries (thyme and chips of toasted garlic mixed into the crispy, salty ).  The only thing he didn't like was the cheese on the burger.  I don't know if he didn't see that Roquefort was listed on the menu, or if he didn't know what kind of cheese it was, but it was pretty gross (not the restaurant's fault, of course).  So, if you've never had it, it is very much akin to gorgonzola, which I think tastes like dirty feet smell.  If you do like that kind of cheese, though, and I know there are people who do, it will probably add to the burger.  Otherwise, ask for no cheese (or maybe substitute something else) because it was hard to scrape off, and it did keep him from eating a few bites where he couldn't get it out of the meat.  He said the meat was seasoned exceptionally well and it was one of the top 5 burgers he's ever had.  *It can take really long if you order the burger medium well or well (as I learned by observing my neighbors), so if you like your meat cooked longer, order it as soon as you can and make sure to get an app or two. The desserts by themselves were nothing super special, but by combining the two of ours, we made something awesome.  He got the flourless chocolate cake (kind of like a very dense, room temp mousse) and I got the hazelnut ice cream.  Putting a bit of each on one spoon created a flavor akin to those little Belgian seashell-shaped chocolates - heavenly! Attentive service, good, reasonable beer 't mind a wait, definitely check it out!",1
23798,1814,4.0,1,2010-05-31,"I am of two minds---and stomachs---when it comes to The Spotted Pig.  Having had two very different experiences at this Mario Batali joint, I've concluded that I mostly (read: 96%) love this spot. My first visit here was with a group of friends for NYE 2010.  After 3 rounds of a drink called The Ginger Bush, which consists of ginger beer and whiskey and is a variation of the Dark & Stormy (ginger beer and dark rum), we were seated by the main window near the entrance.  Our server, a friendly chap in a fedora (we correctly guessed that he was a jazz musician), gave us generous free samples of their celery bisque (heavenly) and then recommended that we try their foie gras appetizer.  We ended up having two rounds of THAT (and two more after the meal).  The burger, which is what I was most excited about, managed to skip my usually detailed scrutiny,  thanks to the several Ginger Bushes I'd already imbibed by the time the food arrived.  All I remember is that it was 'pretty good'. Upon visiting a little over a week ago---in continuation of our search for The Best Burger in NYC, which, honestly, is really just a race for #2 since there's no beating Minetta Tavern's Black Label wonder of the world---the burger finally came under due scrutiny. The Boy loved it.  Currently, it's his #2.  He found the rosemary-seasoned fries to be in perfect complement to the Roquefort burger, which was cooked exactly as he wanted it, was juicy, and, though slightly overpowered by the cheese and not much assisted by the somewhat stale (or dry?) bun, presently remains second in overall standing.  His ""Oink"" rating?  4 out of 5. I have not yet decided where their burger stands.  I generally agree with The Boy's assessment, but  really, really, really hated the bun.  It was, in my opinion, too thick, too dry, and simply not in keeping with the overall quality of the rest of the burger.  But maybe it's supposed to be that way, in order to counteract the juiciness of the meat. As it stands, this place generally rocks.  Good brews on tap, great atmosphere and service, and overall excellent food.  Burger, your ranking is, at present, TBD.",1

Let me first say, this was my first time EVER in the village. But I , While I was waiting i sparked up a conversation with a older gentleman and his wife sitting next to me. They were in town from Ireland and recommended a beer, ""Old Speckled Hen"".  Which apparently is a ale that foams like a Guinness. It's amazing! I ate, my burger was BIG and amazing. Then got to chatting with the friendly bartender. Very nice and sociable, we talked about where he was from, I informed him I'm on vacation, and he actually gave me a few other bars to stop by.

126080,1814,4.0,1,2010-08-07,"What can I say that hasn't been said about The Spotted Pig?  Yet, here is my story: Went by on a Sunday afternoon after brunch and the S.P. was open, but serving only a limited menu (from 3 PM to 5 PM).  The staff was super friendly and we were welcomed into the restaurant.  Shown to a small table in the corner and seated on little benches (which is kind of an odd thing for an aging man who is 6'4"" and over 250 pounds).   We got the almonds and the olives and an order of the Chicken Liver Toasts to start with.  The almonds were delivered and were standard almond encrusted in a nice salty spice crust; a bit disappointed that they were not the newly trendy Marcona almonds, we nonetheless devoured them and thought, ""Marcona schmarcona!""  The olives were spiced in house and served; too many green olives however (for our tastes).  The chicken liver, though, stole the show.  Nicely cooked and flavoured with a bit of wine/brandy and smeared over the top of a lovely toasted piece of foccacia bread, I would gladly eat this any time.  This would be the way to introduce someone who did not like liver to the ""Offal Club"".  Unfortunately, my friend is not just a member, but a Founder of the Offal Club (like me!) and I could not scam (one of only a few selections on the mid-day, post-brunch menu) and asked the waiter if I ordered it medium-rare if they would really cook it medium-rare.  The waiter responded that they grind their own meat for the burgers and cook it to order, just like a steak!  Woo hoo!  Rare/Medium Rare (a gross conceit, but one I must admit!) for me, medium-well for my friend. When it came out, we looked on the plates in amazement.  A HUGE burger on a toasted bun topped with melted blue cheese.  Nothing fancy - no tomato, no lettuce, no pickle.  I put some Dijon mustard on mine and happily bit into it - and felt myself get dizzy from a Foodgasm.  The French Fries were also a thing of beauty.  Thin, crispy, house-made fries to which, in the final 30 seconds, thin slices of garlic and fresh rosemary had been added to sizzle and finish the fries, then salted and served.  There were a mountain of fries.  No way we could eat them all, no matter how absolutely delicious they were. Of course, we ate every bite on our plates.  Every fry.  Every crumb.  Every fried piece of garlic. If this is how they treat burger and fries, I know that I will be back to sample some more of this food.",1
125996,1814,4.0,1,2011-06-11,"Great burger, open late (until 2am), and not ridiculously overpriced like many late night places.

Recommended dishes are the chicken liver toast (the best liver dish I've ever had) and the deviled eggs which aren't your typical homemade ones. The Roquefort burger isn't for everyone's palate, but an above-par burger all in all. Definitely one of the better restaurants in NYC.",1
7582,1814,2.0,1,2009-03-16,"Maybe I'm crazy, maybe my taste buds are out whack, maybe the restaurant was having an off tonight, or maybe my expectations were just too high. But after hearing rave after rave about the burger from Spotted Pig, and after eating many a burger in New York, I have to say I was very disappointed in the whole dish. We started off with the chicken liver toasts which was pretty tasty but very rich. Although they're not the biggest slices triangles of toast because it's so rich you could probably share among 4 people who just wanted to get a good taste of it. We then ordered our burgers. Granted I am not the biggest fan of blue cheese, but the cheese made the burger incredibly salty. Usually there is some sort of balance with the saltiness of the cheese, some sort of crisp component -- something to take the edge off the saltiness and enhance the flavor. But this time it fell flat. All I could taste was the cheese and the beef, though cooked perfectly was tender and juicy, but because of the cheese the entire burger was too salty. Unfortunately the side that came with it, the rosemary shoestring fries, were way, way too salty. I love the idea of fried garlic chips and fried rosemary leaves along with the shoestring fries, and I love skinny, crispy fries, but these were too liberally seasoned with salt. Together, the burger and the fries made for 4 glasses of water and still left me longing for more liquids. It is, admittedly, huge portions (at least the burger and fries were). But considering the flavor, the saltiness, the big disappointment $17 was too much to pay for this experience. The service was good here though -- water was always refilled, our bottle was refilled and returned to our table, the waitress was very friendly and always served with a smile and a chipper attitude. Never gave us a condescending or angry sneer when we didn't order any drinks besides water, or didn't order dessert. No rushing whether or not there was a line waiting for tables. All in ",0
49141,1814,3.0,1,2010-02-17,"After hearing all the hype about The Spotted Pig I felt the need to check it out. It was also a good change from the pretentious restaurants I've been going to latley (, Philippe, Nello's etc.). The Spotted Pig is a very trendy low-key pub that's a mix of a hipster hang-out and a place to people watch. The place is always crowded and since they don't take reservations, getting a table can be a bit difficult. With investors such as Jay-Z & Mario Batali its no wonder the place is so popular. Since Jay-Z bought the building where The Spotted Pig is, they've added an upstairs bar and dining room so this has somewhat helped the large crowds overflowing onto the sidewalks. April Bloomfield is the head chef and the menu consists of Italian & English fused dishes. For lunch the menu isn't really anything to rave about. The Spotted Pig serves their 2 staple dishes (Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi and the Burger with Roquefort Cheese) and basically that's all everyone in the restaurant orders. I saw perhaps one person order the Cubano Sandwich and everyone else either had the Gnudi or the Burger. The whole restaurant is very ""hipster"" from the waiters in Ray-Bands and plaid shirts to the water served in wine bottles and the brown paper over the table cloths. The food however is very gourmet. As an appetizer I had the special of the day which were Duck Eggs with a salad in a vinaigrette and bacon. The dish was good, nothing mind blowing, the saltiness of the bacon went well with the duck eggs and the contrast between the dressing and the saltiness of the bacon was a nice touch. The Burger is served with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries. The cheese's sharp flavor actually went well with the large burger and so did the mountain of Shoestring fries. The gnudi, essentially a ricotta dumpling, was very rich and you could tell the ingredients, such as the sheep ricotta, were fresh. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was a slab of rich chocolate fudge that was a bit too heavy to have all by myself, but if you share it the dish is just fine. While I did enjoy my lunch at The Spotted Pig I do feel the place is a bit overrated. The menu has 2 hits and the rest sort of goes under the radar with most diners. If I were in the area I'd return, but if I was told the wait was longer than 45 minutes I don't think the wait would be worth it.",0

Didn't bother me as there was no one next to us but I would certainly have been uncomfortable if there had been. Service: Perfectly pitched. Drinks: I was pleasantly surprised with the wine list which was extensive for a pub. I enjoyed a glass for Rock Rabbit Sauvignon Blanc - very nice. Food: I had the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and it was the nicest grilled cheese I have ever eaten. It comes with caramelised onions and dijon mustard on the side but I ignored these. The sandwich was perfectly delicious as it was and I found myself savoring every bite. My fiance doesn't eat cheese so he had no option really but to go for the Burger. The lunch menu is big on cheese. He obviously ordered his san Roquefort and had it cooked medium. He described it as 'not quite as good as Minetta, not a patch on Five Guys but very good nonetheless'. It comes with shoestring fries. He thought they were ok but I wasn't a fan. They looked fantastic and the little bits of rosemary and garlic are a nice addition but there's just a whole lot of string and not much else.

49212,1814,3.0,1,2010-07-23,Last night (Thursday) my two friends and i flipped a coin to decide where to get a burger. JG Mellon on the UES or the Spotted Pig in the West Village. As fate was in charge we grabbed a cab and headed to the Pig for one of their trade mark burgers. From memory we arrived at 8pm. Big mistake. The guy at the front told us it would be an hour and half wait. What the?? After downing a few ales at the bar an hour had passed and we were getting hungry and impatient. I decided to try and bribe the door guy. Probably not the best attempt or maybe i should have gone higher than a 20 but at the end of the day its a burger not a lobster or caviar. Finally we were called up stairs and we sat down. The waiter was fairly average but he did manage to get our oysters out to us relatively quickly. These were below average and for the cost ($36 for a dozen) i expected a lot better. We each ordered the burger that came garnished with shredded fries. The burger is amazing soft and full of flavor. They only use a heavy blue cheese and that certainly is enough. My friends on the other hard werent impressed. Does the place have a great burger? yes. Is it worth an hours and a half wait? Hell no. If i was to go back it would be for lunch or on a monday or tuesday night when the crowd dies off.,0
49754,1814,5.0,1,2010-09-28,"After my previous encounter with one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  I discover this gastropub, that holds claim to one of the best burgers in town.  So I decided to see for myself.  Upon arriving you would believe it is a normal store front or even someone's apartment.  Even the decorations themselves would make you believe it is someone's home and that is what gives The Spotted Pig's first impressions.  I looked around and I see a pretty surprising list of beers, one being a cask conditioned beer and another that caught my eye was the raisin flavored beer from Dogfish Head.  The cask conditioned beer at the moment was a four points branded beer and it was definitely one of the finer beers I have ever tasted.  The first smell of the beer is heavenly, has a fruity flavor and slight honey tone.  The bottom of the beer is slightly bitter to the taste but still well crafted.   Now to the main , the grill marks were a sight to admire as it gave a nice contrast to the bun.  The bun was firm and strong, and definitely had a nice firm taste to it with a slight nutty flavor.  The burger was cooked to a medium rare and was perfect in texture, flavor and juiciness.  What topped off the burger though, was the roquefort cheese.  It's a bleu cheese that has a strong flavor, so those who do not like strong cheeses should order something else, but those who can handle it. Will enjoy that there is a big dollop of it on the burger, which gives it a taste that will leave you wanting more. Not to be outdone, the fries were also heavenly.  The shoestring fries were fried with slivers of fresh garlic and dill which gave every bite of fries a wonderful taste that needed no ketchup. Absolutely amazing. The small plates were also very well made, deviled eggs and the ricotta gnudi were an awesome starter food to pick at.

Roasted Pork Belly, again, great.  The top is roasted to resemble a pork rind, a little fatty, as expected, but perfectly cooked.  Covered in broccoli rabe over a base of some of my fave, polenta.  Great great dish.   And the burger.  What else needs to be said.  It has been raved about.  Called possibly the best burger in town.  All is true. The decor is just as awesome as the food.  The space is extremely old, as one can tell by the exposed brick arches, but that works extremely well.  It is quite cozy in there so get in early or prepare to wait.  But I could see the food being worth the wait. Empire Cream Ale on tap is a perfect complement to just about everything they serve.  A top beer anywhere for that matter. All the good, so why not a 5er?  You try getting the attention of any of the ""too cool for the room"" staff and you will see why.",1

I was eating out with a friend after we had heard some really awesome things about The Spotted Pig. We sat down, ordered bar snacks and entrees, and waited and waited. After about twenty minutes the bar snacks arrived and were awesome. I could have eaten the chicken liver toast all night. That was the high point of the night. After another 45 minutes of waiting our waiter came by and assured us that our food was being plated at that moment, and it would be up in ""two minutes"". Fifteen minutes later it did come up. Sadly that was not the end of the problems. While the cider braised pork was very good but small, the polenta it was on was undercooked and very underseasoned. Not worth 28 dollars and definitely not worth the hour and a half wait. I was just very disappointed in the end. I really wanted to like The Spotted Pig, but I won't be coming back.",0

Was really looking forward to it as we were in town from SF for the week and i had heard a lot of good things about the place. Arrived around 7:30pm and were promptly accommodated on the upper floor and provided a high chair for the little lady. Table was small and cramped but we weren't bothered; the waitstaff while looking like many of the too-cool-for-school peoples I have encountered in similar popular hipster establishments in SF lacked the attitude and were very pleasant. Given the late hour (for our daughter) we went straight to the entrees and a round of drinx. The salty dog was fine but the market lemonade was really surprisingly good; more tart and berry like than lemonadey. I owned a bar for 5years so I can appreciate an innovative and tasty cocktail. Entree wise we ordered the seared squid and cannelini beans, strip steak, beet salad and seabass with squash. We all appreciated the skill and thought that went into the dishes but were universally disappointed by the portion sizes. Now keep in mind that this group of diners  were not gastronomically retarded out-of-towners expecting to be filled to stuffing until we rolled out of the joint. We have all eaten all over the world at more places than we (or you) could count. The portion sizes are more in line with what one would expect for a medium to large appetizer. We ended up stopping off at a pizza-by-the-slice place on the walk home. Summation: great food, good service, eat before you go.",0

100760,1814,5.0,1,2007-12-12,"I am normally reluctant to write the 15023452nd review of a popular place. But Spotted Pig deserves it. We came there on a Tuesday night at about 9pm. We got an appalling 1 hour 45 minute wait time for a table. My friend who turned away being told that there's a 2 hour wait time, noticed that the wait times are lower if you're good looking, so she's going to hit the place with a push-up bra next time. But being a man, I couldn't really do push-up bras. I didn't care about the wait time and just barged in - I always find a way. There were people standing and waiting for bar spots. Within 5 minutes we secured two places at a bar, ordered a beer (good but expensive), and proceeded to order food at the bar itself. It reminded me of getting food in Japan. The place was swarming with well-dressed British-looking glamor types, and I was impressed when the waitress could distinguish between Irish and Scottish accents. I've tasted the liver - deliciously made, very buttery inside (almost feared that it's still raw), I loved it even though I normally hate liver. I wanted to see if a master chef can make something horrible taste good. And yes, they can. The best liver of my life. I've also tried the burger. It left me speechless, and I still have warm and fuzzy memories of it. Other Yelpers have described it in more detail. In its perfectly toasted buttery juiciness and blue cheesy spiciness the best burger of my life, at ""only"" the double the price of the average NYC pub burger. The shoestring fries were interesting: they fried them with onion and rosemary, and sprinkled with a lot of salt. I'd actually prefer less salt and would add it myself if necessary.",1

125965,1814,3.0,1,2011-10-13,"Tucked away on a quiet corner, it's easy to walk right by the Spotted Pig without noticing it - if not for the fact that it's packed to the rafters every night.  My friend arrived an hour before me, so I didn't have to wait long, but I did hear them say something about a 90 minute wait to people who came in after us. We went all out on the menu since we didn't want to waste the long wait.  Not sure why, but somehow I started off with a devil theme: Devils on Horsebacks (bacon wrapped pears and apples cubes), and Satan's Whiskers (smooth and fruity gin drink).  I would've picked a beer off their solid beer list (2 cask aged ales), but just wasn't in the mood that night.  The bacon wrapped fruits was surprisingly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad because you can't screw up with bacon wrapped anything, but it didn't blow your mind like a bacon wrapped thingy should. To balance out the forces of evil, we grabbed some sheep milk ricotta gnudi (heh, nude).  I thought this was fantastic.  The ricotta cheese balls are so strong in cheese flavor, you can't help but pop your eyes out a bit. For entrees, I ordered an arctic char with cauliflower, and my friend grabbed the special of the night, slow cooked pork loin.  My fish was perfectly cooked throughout, had a crisp skin, and a creamy white sauce with little chunks of cauliflower swimming around in it.  I loved it. We couldn't sing the same praise about the pork loin though.  The server warned him that it'd be a la carte, but seeing how it was the special, and how it was priced similarly as the other entrees, he picked it.  It came out as a plate of sliced pork.  Most of it was pretty dry and tough, and it sat in a salty broth.  It would've been fantastic as a leftover pork sandwich (picture coleslaw and salty pork on a rye roll), but incredibly disappointing for a place called the ""Spotted Pig"". It's good food, but with other options near by, I'd have to pass next time.  They might've had an off day with the pork, but if you do visit, I'd recommend a non-pig dish at the Spotted Pig.",0

No problem finding a place to sit and it was quiet enough to carry on a conversation. The patrons were an eclectic mix of gay guys, Jersey suburban types, and late 40s/early 50s singles and couples. The food looked great (burgers piled high with thin French fries) so I might have to include dinner on my next visit. Tab before tax/tip for two tasty Dark and Stormies was $24. Stopped here again on a Friday night but this time for dinner. It was packed but we managed to carve out a spot by the window and had a couple drinks while we waited for a table to open (about 60-90 minutes). I had the halibut which was great and my friend had the plate of 5 sides, also delicious. This plus about 4-5 drinks was $104 before tax/tip.",1
12600,1814,4.0,1,2012-06-26,"April Bloomfield + exclusive reputation + bangin' burger + hip atmosphere = one of my new favorites. Tom brought me here for my birthday after the Book of Mormon (awesome) on a Friday night, so we were able to snag a nice table by the window due to the late hour.  I've heard horror stories of 2 hour wait-times +, but we literally had no problem at all.  So my first recommendation - come late-night, like 10:30PM or so, on a Friday. It's still absolutely poppin', but the regular 9pm dinner crowd is filing out and it presents a rare window of opportunity for seating, either on the first floor bar or upstairs dining area. I'd gone to hear April Bloomfield speak earlier that week, and was able to get a copy of her book signed (as if I ever , as a fan, I can still admire.)  She's famous for her pork dishes, and as it's a gastropub, one should order beer.  I went completely off-script and opted for the Gnudi (pasta similar to gnocchi / ravioli) with pesto - yum. Super heavy dish, but portioned tiny enough that it's manageable. Tom is on a quest to find the best burger in NYC - The Little Owl and Corner Bistro are both top contenders - but Spotted Pig butted its way in with a strong entry.  Rare, crumbly, buttery burger with sharp cheese spread.  So good.  The shoestring fries are fine, but a little excessive.  It's served with what can only be described as a bushel of shoestring fries, and they're so thin, they almost don't taste like anything.  It's kind of like - ok, I get it, thin  Anyway, a small complaint for an otherwise awesome meal.

126038,1814,4.0,1,2011-01-08,"Really awesome dinner! Really cute atmosphere, nice and cozy. Started out with a pitcher of pimm's cup at the , really sweet though. Once we were seated we ordered the deviled eggs, devils on horseback, and chicken liver toast. Oh my god the chicken liver toast is something I could eat every fucking day. SO DELICIOUS. The deviled eggs were really good too, really rich and smooth with great flavor. The devils on horseback were good, but not my favorite. My friend really loved them though. Next we ordered the sheeps milk gnudi, the prosciutto ricotta tart with marjoram, and the fluke crudo. The gnudi was really great, very creamy and subtly sweet. The prosciutto tart was excellent, it was like a puff pastry type tart with prosciutto and marjoram. It was soOOOOOOOOO good, so light and airy. It was like a bomb ass salad over puff pastry (which is like my favorite thing EVER). The crudo was 'm not huge on sashimi but it was fresh and light so it was a good thing to have since we ordered like everything on the menu. For our entree meal my friend and I ordered pork belly with a side of Brussels sprouts. The pork belly was good, but not as good as I would have liked. I think we got a piece with a higher fat ratio than normal, because it was like 100% fat instead of having a little meat on it. It was probably the richest pork belly I've ever had so I couldn't eat much of it. I think it would have been really good if it had something to cut the richness. My friend loved it though, I think it was her first time having pork belly too (she's a ""vegetarian""). THE BRUSSELS SPROUT ARE INSANE! They were so tender and perfectly caramelized. It was my friend who insisted on ordering them but I am really glad we did. I bet their other sides are incredible as well. For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the creme dessert (creme brulee). They were both amazing. The chocolate cake was delicious and dense and really rich but so divine (i'm not even a chocolate fan) and the creme one was awesome too. All in all it was a really great restaurant and was a fun time. I would give it 4.5 stars. It was the perfect meal to end my trip to NYC with! GO TO THE SPOTTED PIG!",1

The hostess, bartender, and waitress were all extremely nice and courteous. The wait was over a hour, and we killed some time by eating cupcakes nearby and also getting drinks at the bar. We eventually got sat upstairs in a nook, which was cute and comfortable. We shared two plates and two entrees. The two plates were the prosciutto & ricotta tart and sheep's milk ricotta gnudi. The tart was good though not particularly memorable. The gnudi plate had cheesy balls that tasted heavenly. This was our favorite dish of the night. The two entrees were the skate and the pork belly. The pork belly was crispy so that was an interesting textural spin on the dish, but I love pork belly and so I expected a lot from it, and I've had better. The skate was cooked very well, but it's also not the best I have had. The sauce of the skate dish had some confusing flavors. The food was good, but like I said I expected more from the fame and the price. For me, Spotted Pig didn't live up to the hype.",0
75886,1814,5.0,1,2011-04-13,"This all began with Jim Halpert. In The Office, Jim and Karen eat at The Spotted Pig and I've been wanting to eat here since then. Finally, for spring break 2011, I was fortunate enough to spend a week in New York and out of the 2 dozen places we tried, this is my favorite restaurant. The reason? Three words: Chicken Liver Toast Holy mother of God. This $5 dish (and one of my momma's dishes) are the foods that I'd request to eat before I die (oh, I should update my Yelp profile). And sadly, there's a side of me that wishes I never tried it, because now life is remembered and divided as Pre-Chicken Liver Toast and Post-Chicken Liver Toast. Please open a location in LA! The burger with Roquefort cheese was a delight, make sure you order the toast and burger! The deviled eggs were okay too, but the other 2 dishes stole its thunder. When I visit again, I'm going to order 2 chicken liver toasts for myself! Ok, maybe 3, they're worth the extra hour of cardio! If I lived in NY, I'd definitely come here regularly. Oh, and the service was superb! We arrived at 6 PM on a Friday night and there was no wait :)",1
7215,1814,5.0,1,2012-08-23,"This place is a bit out of the way in the West Village, but it's a must go to spot if you love beef and pork. I went here with a friend on a Thursday night. I arrived around 6:40pm, and the wait was only 20-30 minutes for the table. The place is small, well at least on the main floor, but it does open up a bit upstairs. However, i still think overall the restaurant is small and may be as small as Minetta Tavern. I know i do mention that sometimes great things come in small packages, and the Spotted Pig is no exception. For apps, we shared Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto and Crispy Pig's Ear Salad with Lemon Caper Dressing. The Ricotta Gnudi was made so delicately. It was a pretty refined dish for the restaurant. The pesto was fresh tasting, but it was a bit overpowering. I had to scoop off some of the pesto, so the freshly made ricotta could be the star of the plate. Overall, the Ricotta Gnudi was mildly salty and sweet, and it wasn't too heavy at all. The Crispy pig ear salad was bananas. The crispy pig ears were literally pig ears; they didn't even bother to trim the ears into small slices. The pork was perfectly deep fried, It was crispy on the outside, but when you bite into it, the juices of the melted fat just explode. The pig ears are salty and the tangy lemon dressing with mixed greens really complement the ears. The salad had endives as well as other bitter veggies, so the dish had bitterness, tang, saltiness, and multiple levels of texture. For entrees, my friend got the famous Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort & Shoestrings. I got the Pork Sausage special.  The burger was flavorful and juicy, even cooked to medium. The bun had great grill marks and it was buttery and toasted to perfection. The burger paired with the roquefort cheese was a perfect marriage. The shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. None of the fries tasted soggy. The sausages , so that was great too. Overall the food here was AWESOME, and the fact that the wait wasn't long was pleasantly refreshing.",1

The spotted pig burger was not bad - it's beef with roquefort cheese - the roquefort was obviously delicious but it kind of masked the taste of the beef - which didn't have enough flavour of it's own. What saved the day were the mound of truffle fries which came with generous sprigs of rosemary, which were a delight to eat in and of themselves.

We went at 6pm on a Sunday to avoid the crowd, but there was still a 30 minute wait. No worries, though -- we had a drink at White Horse Tavern and they called us when our table was ready. We were seated upstairs, and the atmosphere was that of an old school tavern. It was bustling, but not uncomfortably so. I started with a deviled egg ($4). It was tasty. Certainly above average, but it didn't blow me away. However, my friend got the ""Devils on Horseback"" ($7), and they were phenomenal. For me, they were the highlight of the night. Since this was my first visit, I decided to go with the burger ($16), medium-rare. It was perfectly cooked -- so juicy. The cheese (roquefort) was a little sharp for my tastes. I would have opted for a milder cheese, but it didn't take anything away from the meal. And I have to briefly rave about the bun. With big restaurant burgers, I often find it difficult to get through the bun without lots of frustration -- I usually end up employing a knife. However, this bun was perfect. The burger came with a heaping side of shoestring potatoes. It was quite the pile, and our whole group ended up picking away at it. They were really tasty -- served with just the right amount of salt, fried garlic, and lots of rosemary. My friend got the gnudi ($15), which was also delicious. I wouldn't make the gnudi my main course unless I supplemented it with a couple of sides. It wasn't small, but it wouldn't have filled me up. The service was also excellent.

Upon review this morning, our favorite items were the octopus salad, the ham entree with horseradish sauce, and the fresh peas (which were a special).   We know the Spotted Pig gets hyped a lot.  I can easily imagine how, on a bad night, it could be a mess.  But for us, it was more than worth the trip.",1

I was slightly  worried about the wait since there are no reservations and lines have been known to be famously long. But thank goodness, it was a Monday. We were told 30mn, which really came about to 15mn. Casual ambiance inside. Smaller and darker than I expected. Hubby  of course ordered the char-grilled burger with Roquefort cheese. Those shoestring fries with Rosemary that it came with were the bomb! I'm not a deviled eggs fan, but with it all the fanfare I had to try them here. It was super creamy and full of flavor.  I went  with the Ricotta cheese Gnudi which was quite satisfying and filling as an entree. Decent service. Good wine and cocktail selection. I loved that South African Sauvignon Blanc on the list. Would love to go back for an actual pig dish (pork belly or pig ear salad) Overall,  the lesson ! Just go to a place for their well-known dishes and you'll happier. PS: their wifi is pigpigpig (how cute)",1

Then, I go to the restroom on the second floor and I see others 8 seats available, 3 & 3 + 2. WE WASTED 40 minutes looking one table for 4 available on the first floor and decided to kindly ask again what's is going on? They told us that's because They were calling a few clients numbers and waiting them to come from their houses??? because They've a reservation. THAT MEANS the spotted pig PASS OVER a real client to wait a virtual client. I'll never be back and I won't recommend at all..

And I must admit, it was a tad to stuffy in there for my taste- downstairs, anyway. (When I say stuffy I mean hot and ) Upstairs it's less crowded and less noisy. At this first trip I noticed the curiously pleasing menu item- fried pig ears with sage, lemon and capers. Sounded delish. So we made it a point to stop by another night for dinner to try this fun little dish. Wasn't on the menu. So, be ware, it switches up frequently even though the same items sort of rotate. Instead I had the beef tongue which was so tender and juicy and tasty! Next NY trip, I'll probably poke my head in for a bite or drink again. Oh, and they have awesome tshirts.",1

We were seated immediately at the bar and then offered an upstairs table. Used to a long wait here since they don't take reservations, that was surprising and super nice, although we discovered that the bar/first floor was much cooler than upstairs with a broken air conditioner. Stuffy air, close quarters, sweaty bodies; this is how people must've felt back in the Revolutionary War days when this building was probably built. Four of us ordered the burgers and shoestring fries. I thought the burger was ok although I ordered a medium and received medium rare. I like medium rare beef, but not on a burger due to Mom warnings (she's always right). The food runner probably mixed up the plate placements since the four of our orders were flip-flopped. Maybe they should have those little ""Medium Rare"" sticks on , maybe because of the roquefort cheese and over-seasoning of the meat. Each order came with a huge mound of shoestring fries, and although everyone else finished theirs, I could barely get half in my mouth. To me they were way too salty. You probably won't spot me here too much in the future, unless out-of-town friends put this on their Must-Do list.

46979,1814,3.0,1,2008-11-05,"Was I the only New Yorker who hadn't been to The Spotted Pig? Apparently so, because when I divulged this to my girlfriends over dinner, I got a couple of chuckles. In order to best avoid the dinner rush, my friends and I arrived at The Spotted Pig around 5:30 'd heard, I was pleasantly surprised when our table was ready for us by 6:15 , tree-lined West Village street, The Spotted Pig is adorned with unfinished hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, an old-fashioned mahogany bar, menu specials written on a large brasserie mirror and decor consisting of shabby chotchkies and mismatched plants. To start, I ordered the deviled eggs followed by the infamous Spotted Pig burger (that I'd read so many raves about). The ""eggs"" (note the pluralization) were just one whole egg sliced in half. The cooked yolks were mixed with a zesty mustard blend, crunchy green chives and sprinkled with sea salt. Though I've had better versions, these devils were tasty and just ""enough"" substance to whet my appetite. The moment of truth came as my medium-cooked burger arrived. Enveloped between a grilled brioche bun was a generous portion of beef topped with an ample lathering of pungent and salty Roquefort cheese. Accompanying the sandwich was a mound of homemade shoestring fries, lightly dusted with sea salt and rosemary. Was the burger all it was cracked up to be? Indeed, it was. Though I felt that the amount of Roquefort used was slightly overpowering, the beef patty itself consisted of the highest quality ground meat, producing a juicy, velvety, melt-in-your-mouth masterpiece. My experience at The Spotted Pig was virtually liberated of anything negative that I'd heard. I found the service to be excellent and our wait-time minimal. The food was pretty impressive and I will absolutely return.",0

The cheese was perfect and the meat in the burger is perfectly thick. The shoestring fries were amazing. The deviled eggs are the BEST I've ever had! It had this extra kick to it. And the chicken liver toast was really good! You can't even taste the liver. That means the chef knows what he's doing when he's cooking liver. We also got the ravioli which had this pop of cheese inside. When you bite into it, the cheese explodes in your mouth. It's soooooooooooooooooo good. I will definitely come back.

Our friends came earlier and they said the wait was only 30 minutes, so we rushed over. However, by the time we got there, it was an hour long. The host wrote down our name and then also mentioned if we find a seat at the bar, we could order from the full menu! So we head upstairs and quickly find a seat. There are drink menus laid out but no food menus. I was confused at first and didn't know if we were supposed to order at the bar along with our food, but it turns out there is a specific waitress who takes orders for people sitting at the bar! But be careful not to try to order from any one else, some of the waiters/waitresses are rude as hell if you're not a part of their section. So my boyfriend and I order drinks and then we get started on the food. We got marinated olives, the sweet corn soup, sauteed squid, and pork belly. We originally had planned to get a burger, but didn't anticipate coming here because we heard how bad the wait could be, so we passed on that. Every plate was delicious. Flavorful, good presentation, all that junk. So we are finishing up our food and decide to get dessert. However, our friends who came by before us a little bit earlier that night insisted that we HAD to get the burger. My boyfriend and I are both pretty full at this 's our last night, we might as well try it. So I order the vanilla ice cream with blueberries and he decides to get the burger. The blueberries are cooked with Hendricks gin, and the ice cream is perfect. Best dessert. After, the burger comes out. The shoestring fries it comes with are really good. The thing I typically hate about thin fries is that it's mostly just crunchy with no bit of softness of the potato, but these definitely did not lack that! They were delicious. And the , with no onions, lettuce, or anything that's on a traditional burger. However, there is bleu cheese, mmmm. Also, a thing to note, a lot of the waiters/waitresses were really rude, but ours was awesome. I wish I could remember her name but she was wearing glasses and a sleeveless shirt. She ruled.

The chicken liver toast is simply outrageous and indulgent.  The liver is richer and fattier than most.  The deviled egg is awesome - one egg cut in half topped generously with chives, salt and somethin' spicy! The burger is, well, just plain amazing.. love the beef, love cave aged Roquefort, love the toasted bun and shoestrings.  The gnudi is great, and while a buttery, creamy, and cheesy delight, is pretty one dimensional (save for the crispy sage which really gets me going), but sometimes I kinda dig that. Amazing rotating beer selection on draught and 2 casks, as well as killer cocktails.  And the staff is just plain awesome - they make you feel loved and at home.   It's always crowded, so stop in during the week on an off-hour.  I like sitting at the upstairs bar - it can get tight but with some patience a seat or two can be found.",1

OK, the waitress kindly gave us a warning, but we nevertheless were sitting on uncomfortable stools in a really hot room, which did not make the wait any better. The burgers finally arrived and they did not disappoint. However, they are huge and so is the portion of shoestring potatoes that accompany the dish, so I definitely recommend for the average person to split this dish.

14321,1814,4.0,1,2009-02-01,"The Spotted Pig definitely has hidden cameras hooked up to their host stand, or the host himself most certainly has some sort of camera embedded into his pupils. The fact that my friend and I were able to put our names down, go upstairs for forty-five minutes, and be approached by a server with menus who never saw us before but knew the name, was remarkable. A point to note: I have never been to the Spotted Pig but I was absolutely taken in by all of the pig decor and the lively feel of the bar area. Definitely like a classy British pub. My friend and I were seated downstairs and were left to mull over what the hell to get. I'm usually the one who takes charge, commanding that my friends order this this and this, but with no prior knowledge I let my friend decide with everything. Here's what we ordered: 1) Devils on Horseback - a first for me. I can't think of a better combination than sticky sweet prunes and smoky bacon. Orgasm in bite size form. 2)  Rollmops - I was always curious about this Dutch delicacy, so I jumped at the opportunity to have some. Delicious, but probably more so if you like fish. 3) Chicken Liver on Toast - At first I was skeptical, not being a huge fan of liver, but I have to say this spreadable organ, combined with the excellent bread, was like having a crush on the kid who previously pulled my hair throughout kindergarten. 4) Smoked haddock chowder - the complete antithesis of the goop fit for invalids from my youth. This chowder seemed to have a mirepoix of potatoes and fish, to use the term loosely, but I was enamored by the precise cubes that dominated the flavorful soup. The homemade crackers were like crunchy little pillows for Thumbalina(Thumbelina?): fabulous. 5) Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi - I felt it was necessary to get the Pig's most well known dish, just to see what all of the fuss was about. It's the classic unfinishable dish - it's extremely rich and very heavy, but three little balls won't set you back too much. 6) Crispy Pig's Ear Salad - another first for me, but a tasty one. I always assumed pigs' ears would be chewy  and more likely to be gnawed on, but this was extremely creamy, with the outward appearance of a giant dorito turned inside of itself. So creamy and fatty in fact, that I had to use the toothpicks from the devil's on horseback to unstick it from my teeth. Anyway, what made the dish a winner was its pairing with plenty of lettuces and a super acidic vinaigrette. An unusual dish worthy of trying out. To end the night, we had tea because we couldn't possibly tackle dessert. While everything was delicious and the atmosphere convivial and exciting, I was put off by how incredibly fast everything came out.  We weren't even finished with appetizers before the soup we shared came out, and we weren't even finished with that before the entrees were plopped down on the tiny table.
