Answer received? ""It's been served like that for 10 years and it's never been a problem"".  Mind you, there's a grilled cheese on the menu (so clearly another cheese is on hand) ... and they also offered to take the cheese off (I guess I should have my cheeseburger sans cheese). But apparently it disturbs the kitchen's flow to just throw a different cheese on a burger while it's grilling ... Unfortunately I cannot recommend this establishment (with seats so tight you might as well sit on your date's lap) ",0

125279,1814,1.0,-1,2014-09-09,I am a native New Yorker who first visited the Spotted Pig 10 years ago. I decided to have dinner with two buddies of mine. I put my name down on the list and was told the wait would be an hour which was fine. After an hour of waiting I was told it would we were up next for a table. After an additional 30 minutes of waiting we were seated. I complained to the host who said they had large parties. You think he could have offered up one round of beers on the house. While the burger was good is wasn't great and NOT worth a 1.5 hour wait. Tiny little restrooms and a very uncomfortable dining experience on account of how diminutive the physical space of the restaurant is. The shoe string fries were Horrible. I will never go back and stick with 5 Napkin Burger instead.,0

125281,1814,1.0,-1,2014-07-06,TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Don't bother. Doesn't live up to the hype. Doesn't offer any brown liquor cocktails. A well whiskey Old Fashioned was $13. The burger was the only reason it got A star. I asked for lettuce and tomato for my burger and was told I could order a salad on top of my $21 burger if I wanted lettuce with it. Completely unacceptable. Bottom line ... Will never go back!!!,0
125282,1814,1.0,-1,2014-05-24,"Impolite and unprepared hostess, we were disrespected I went to Spotted Pig on May 15th and had the most terrible experience with an employee of the restaurant. The hostess was very impolite, spoke very loud, and had no patience in answering doubts. We had to wait in line for almost 2 hours because she was unprepared on managing the list, and also because she noticed that my wife was upset so I believe she did it on purpose as well, because she was sarcastic all the time, calling my wife a delightful person, and after a almost 2 hour wait said that would buy drinks for us given the wait which never happened, she was really being sarcastic and making fun of (but we were early and had no one waiting outside, just some couples inside), but we were a party of 4 and instead of putting 2 tables together every couple that came in got a table (when we finally got a table, we saw many empty tables in the second floor, because the hostess is not a good manager). Also, we saw at least 2 parties of 4 arriving after us and she gave them a table before us. We complained and she spoke loud saying that they arrived before us, but we had been there for almost 2 hours so we saw the face of everyone in line, and it is not like they have phone msgs to alert you on the , I sincerely wish that management do something about it. In order for them to know which person I am talking about, I am giving her physical characteristics since I never got her name: she was African american and overweight. I believe I only got a table because the hostess overheard me talking about a web review. I am glad tools like this exist so persons like this don't get away with mistreating employees and management can know what is really going on in their restaurants. After this bad experience, even a Michelin restaurant food would taste bad. Many thanks",0

I enjoy walking around the Village and Manhattan/Chelsea area.  My friend was boasting about this place telling me ""ohhhh please we have to go there it's so awesome.""  I am unsure what planet he lives on for liking this  Anyway I wanted a snack before dinner.  So I ordered some apps.  I barely even ate my food because it really did not taste well.  What I mean by this is undercooked fish and some kind of bread mixed with something that tasted like cat shit.   We were sitting at the bar so I was hoping the dumbass bartender would have said ""How is everything?...""  Anyway he did not.  This is my fault I should have probably said something but I did not want to embarrass my friends etc.  I am very polite so I would have been nice but still I just did not want to be ""that girl.""  Anyway needless to say next time I am in NY I will not be hanging here.

If crowds make you think the food is really good- go for it. I guess it makes good business sense to have people order lots of drinks while they wait and wait for a table or food while cheery smiling wait staff promise it will happen. Otherwise, stay away.

It was raining cats and dogs outside so I left my friends at home while I ran down to put my name down since I knew there would be a wait. When the hostess asked if we were all there I said yes the rest are just up the street. She then got really nasty and in a patronizing voice asked if all four were 'in the building' as if she had to spell it out for me. I felt like I was in line to order a Big Mac at the MacDonalds, I have been treated better at the CVS around the corner, not to mention the Starbucks. Needless to say I didn't dine at the Spotted Pig that night and have no intention of making that mistake again.

It was very weird because We could see one free table for 4, another for 3 and the last one for 2 on the first floor, at least 9 seats available. Then, I go to the restroom on the second floor and I see others 8 seats available, 3 & 3 + 2. WE WASTED 40 minutes looking one table for 4 available on the first floor and decided to kindly ask again what's is going on? They told us that's because They were calling a few clients numbers and waiting them to come from their houses??? because They've a reservation. THAT MEANS the spotted pig PASS OVER a real client to wait a virtual client. I'll never be back and I won't recommend at all.. If you were really full we wouldn't mind waiting one hour having beers.",0

Per usual, a two hour wait during rush hour but we stuck it out and were seated upstairs in slightly less than the estimated 2.5 hour response from the hostess. The pretentious group of young women seated next next to us completely ruined what could have been a great meal. The hipster waitstaff was slow and unattentive throughout the entire meal. When the girls next to us became unbearable and even the wait staff noticed how obnoxious they were, all we got was a shoulder shrugg and a half hearted appololgy.

125297,1814,1.0,-1,2012-03-28,"TERRIBLE. My experience was horrible. It wasn't not the long wait in line. It was the service. I wanted to order a burger after all the food came because the portions were smaller than we had expected. The portions were small like at a high-end restaurant and the prices are very similar to a high-end restaurant. All of this is fine. I can accept. But the waitress said ""I can't add on anything else after food comes. It's our kitchen policy. And the burger takes an hour."" Then I said ""I have an hour to wait."" The reply i got was ""We don't have an hour to wait because we have people waiting an hour and a half for a table. Plus you didn't order much."" Wow wow, what is that suppose to mean? She didn't mention that they don't do additional orders when we first ordered our food. It's not my fault Spotted Pig doesn't take reservations and don't take additional orders, both criteria that almost ALL mid-range and high-end restaurants have. I've never had such an obnoxious service in my life. I felt I wasn't welcomed there and the waitress just wanted to kick us out. This place is more like a pub service. First come first serve basis. People come in, eat quickly and get out. I , but there are many places with good food. For the prices they have, I can do fine dining at a more comfortable restaurant with high-quality food and service. The most important thing is i can sit for 2 hours and would still feel welcomed. At Spotted Pig, it's not a place for dates or sports games or relaxing dinner. It's over-rated.",0

It is essentially peasant food, pioneered in Ile de France and transferred to the UK during the Norman invasion. So I don't quite understand how anyone can deem this dish ""innovative."" It is the culinary equivalent to reinventing the wheel. ANYONE can make a high-fat burger heavy on the garlic on thyme.  Now, for some reason it is some kind of culinary chimera we have to pay $17 for. This is insulting.

125299,1814,1.0,-1,2011-11-07,It was a quiet Tuesday lunch at the restaurant we waited and waited and waited finally a server acknowledged us not particularly friendly.

How could I have lost my own card when I relinquished it to the waitress and didn't get it back???

I never complain in restaurants but no one has ever spoken to me like that.  Although the manger apologized there was no concession when the bill came and moreover he overcharged us for drinks. For the money they are charging I would never go here again. I love to go to nice places but the Spotted Pig thinks that they are so hip that they can dispense with customer service. News flash- when I go out to a nice dinner, I expect the entire meal to be enjoyable including a waitstaff who wants to give the diner a pleasant dining experience.  If you make a mistake own it- don't blame the customer.

Although there were plenty of tables available, he showed me to a tiny one located right in front of the kitchen (and hence uncomfortably noisy). Over the course of the meal, I came to the conclusion that the Spotted Pig only hires employees who are slow, surly, and seemingly hard of hearing. Service was, in other words, absolutely atrocious. I ordered the chargrilled burger & shoestring fries because that is what they're supposedly known for. It arrived after 40 minutes and was not at all impressive.

The quality of the meat itself was good, but roquefort just overpowered any sense of that with its brininess. It was nearly inedible. BTW, I love blue and cheese and I love hamburgers but this burger clearly missed the mark.

They had a good IPA on tap, but the signature burger had a sharp skunky cheese on it that was less than adept, and the shoe string fries, though nice with the rosemary, were so small that it was impractical to eat. Oh, yeah, and overpriced no doubt. Burger was over $20 and like I said was not good. I'd suggest that the place revamp and recharge or get out while it's still somewhat cool.",0

What I found was a cheeseburger that was too greasy, cooked incorrectly and lacking anything memorable. Bareburger is half the price and SIGNIFIGANTLY better in all seriousness. We also had a fish item which was as honestly as I could say, just fine. The seating is tight, the crowd is nerve-gratingly 'cool' but I can say the space has character, even if the food doesn't.  I could best describe this place like a Louis Vuitton hand bag.  Everyone (in certain circles) wants one, the price is too high, those people need to be seen with one, but at the end of the day, it is just a bag with a bunch of weird L and Vs all over it posing as a $2000 superbag without any of the merits to warrant it (not that the place is outrageously expensive, but my point should stand), if you want bbq go to bluesmoke, I guarantee you better food at either.  So, in conclusion, other than the 1 in 1000 shot of seeing Jay-Z, too much hype, not enough substance.",0

The waitress came to take our order and to be honest was pretty rude, and the whole ordering experience was a bit awkward. We ordered the lamb, but they said it would take btwn 45 mins to an hour to cook. We were in a little rush, so we decided on the bugers instead. The burgers , but I'm not here to say their food was bad, just not our taste. My biggest problem was that the staff seemed rude and I felt burned after spending $20 on a burger and not liking it.

Whoever wrote good reviews of the burger, I encourage to think again that you just paid $20 for a burger that does not even come with tomato and lettuce.   A burger from Shake Shack is tastier at a fraction of the cost.   If you look for burger,  read this review from cbs.   … I could not find any good words to describe this place, service: 2, food: 2.5; decoration: 2; price: 1.  Meh ",0
92437,1814,2.0,-1,2012-07-11,"We had a party of 6. The hostess was really helpful and honest in how long the wait was going to be. She told us it would be at least 2 hours and that she would gives us a call when there is about 30 minutes left. She was great. That's where the good experience ended. We waited for about 2-2.5 hours to get a table. When finally getting to the table, it took awhile for the server to take our order. Once she did it took more than an HOUR for our food to arrive and we only ordered burgers. We asked our server 3 times about the food and she just said, it will be just another minute or so. A couple of people in our party decided to leave because the food was taking so long. We asked to speak with the manager (who never came) rather someone told us they would charge us for only four burgers rather than the 6 and that it was a full restaurant. That's not compensation- that's a given. We asked to have them packed. We let our friends know the food finally came out so they came back to the restaurant. They came back to the restaurant but one person in the party asked for medium and the burger came out raw. With everything that happened, she didn't want to wait any longer and she sent the burger back not wanting anything else. When we got the bill, we were charged for 5 burgers even though they said we would only be charged for 4. We asked to speak with the gentlemen who told us we would only be charged for 4 and he said since they came back and ate, he had to charge us and there was nothing he could do about it.   We went to this restaurant because we heard it was good. When you hear about a good restaurant, you're going to be full more often than not. So to use that as an excuse as to why our burgers were taking more than hour is not acceptable. The manager never showed up and even though they knew our food was taking a long time, no one ever apologized or offered any compensation. I'm giving it two stars because the burger was decent, but not worth the wait or the attitude we got from the employees.",0

We had the chicken liver toast, which was good, even though it's hard to get through that much liver sometimes.  My real problem was with the entrees. My girlfriend had a dish that was 16 dollars and literally consisted of about 6 thin slices of speck and about 6 or seven roman (tiny) artichoke hearts.  It was average at best. My 20 dollar burger was good, though the Roquefort was a little bit overpowering.  And though the shoestring fries were good, they did not make up for the price of the slightly above average burger.  My two other friends ordered Cuban sandwiches which they said were good, but a little dry.   Service was ok, though a bit Inattentive at times.  The atmosphere is very laid back, which was nice.  In the end though, the food disappointed and was overpriced.  I hate to say it, but this place defines overrated.",0

I've worked in the food business and know what things cost.  There is no way any burger unless, it's topped with gold leave should cost $20 big ones. Give me a break.  If people would say no to outlandish food prices maybe the owners would get smart and make their prices more realistic.  They act like everyone in the city works on Wall Street and makes 200 grand a year.  How about a break for us poor working stiffs.",0

Most everyone who came in for dinner had to wait 90 min, but I must say the woman at the desk was incredibly patient and very polite with everyone.   We had a great table, and the food was wonderful. But not so wonderful in terms of being so over priced.  The entrees are basically the meat or the fish with some beautifully prepared sauce. But if you want anything to side with it, you have to order that separately.  We ordered the bass, the skate, the skirt steak and the burger. The fries were so-so, the fish was terrific , the burger was kind of ordinary. However, except for the big pile of fries with the hamburger, the main dishes came with  a lot of bare dish i. At  $32,. No sides. They are extra at $8 apiece.   The portions are artfully  presented with wonderful sauces, but so small most of us  wound up eating a lot of bread - the olive oil served with the bread is amazing.  The ambiance is nice - little pigs everywhere, and the wait staff is friendly, and well trained.  But the noise level especially with the ceiling made of tin, and the pipes is so loud that it was very difficult to have a conversation. Thus the reason for the two stars  - basically that for each wonderful experience, there was a downside.  Tasty food, but small portions and way overpriced.  Friendly earthy sweet decoration, but terrible noise level, friendly well trained staff but because of the crowds, very over burdened.  I am glad I tried the Spotted Pig, but I won't be returning.",0

But in NO way does it deserve not just one michelin star but several years in a row!! I have lost respect for what that means now. My toast was burned. My mussels had no flavour AT all. The burgers which other people ordered were meat in a bun (hardly the best Ive ever seen nor inventive!) and the soup might as well have been straight out of a can.

I was eating out with a friend after we had heard some really awesome things about The Spotted Pig. We sat down, ordered bar snacks and entrees, and waited and waited. After about twenty minutes the bar snacks arrived and were awesome. I could have eaten the chicken liver toast all night. That was the high point of the night. After another 45 minutes of waiting our waiter came by and assured us that our food was being plated at that moment, and it would be up in ""two minutes"". Fifteen minutes later it did come up. Sadly that was not the end of the problems. While the cider braised pork was very good but small, the polenta it was on was undercooked and very underseasoned.

125335,1814,2.0,-1,2010-04-12,"I went into the Spotted Pig having heard rave reviews.  I came out feeling like my rights as a patron had been taken away from me. First of all, the only thing mildly affordable on the menu is the burger for $17.  Everything else, and I mean everything outside of appetizers, was above $25.  The beer selection was good, but, pints started at $8.  A local Five Points beer was priced at $10.  $10 for a LOCAL beer!!! I can find the same beer for half the price at most bars.  No excuse. When I received the burger, which did look delicious with it's gourmet meat patty and rich blue cheese and hefty amount of shoe-string fries, I noticed there were no condiments other than ketchup and mustard.  I asked my server for lettuce and tomato, which he promptly refused.  I ask why -- did they not have lettuce and tomato in the kitchen?  No.  The chef apparently refuses to offer anything with the burger except for ketchup and mustard.  No amount of pleading could get the server to bring me out simple lettuce and tomato.  In fact, what he did tell me was that I could order a salad (!) if I wanted lettuce and tomato.  I did enjoy the burger, but, yes, it would have been much better with lettuce and tomato.  The chef's arrogant attitude about how his food should be enjoyed has gotten completely out of hand.  This kind of pure disregard for what the customer desires has become more and more commonplace in New York City's trendy restaurants. I do not recommend this place unless, (1) you have a lot of money and don't mind spending it, (2) you don't mind waiting close to an hour for a table, and (3) you don't mind bringing your own condiments (BYOC) as they will not give you any.",0

It is not overrated due to price though, I am from SF and am very used to overpriced food, but rather due to how good the food is. We started with 3 orders of deviled eggs, and a plate of Bouchot Mussels with Tomato & Herbs. The eggs were not as good as what you can make at home, even if you have never made them. They had no flavor and tasted like parsley or whatever they had sprinkled on them. There were like 2 little millimeter chunks of bacon on each half egg. The muscles were in a good sauce and tasted great. For dinner I got the burger, my girlfriend and her sister both got the Crispy Pork Belly in Broth with Fall Vegetables & Pumpkin Fritters. The burger was cooked the way I asked, but it is no better than what you will get at burger bar or jenny's giant burger. The fries looked cool, but were hella oily and super salty, which I did not appreciate. I tried some of their pork belly, which was not crispy at all; it was actually very soggy and chewy. The portion size of the crispy pork belly is a joke. Look at all of the pictures of the burger posted here now imagine that burger cut into fourths, and that is the portion size of the pork belly.

125365,1814,3.0,-1,2010-09-29,"When I hear about this place I hear about their burgers. So I came and checked it out for myself. To be honest, its pretty rediculous. I have no idea how the hell this place became noted for their burger because it sucked. I guess people in the west village get a kick out of being told ""no you cant have lettuce tomato or onion on your burger"" because they are so used to everyone kissing their ass because they got a deep wallet. I dunno, just a random thought because really it makes no sense to me at all. It's an average patty, not all that big, not really flavored much/mixed with onions or anything. Doesnt seem hand made. Its on an above average bun and comes with blue cheese and thats it. The blue cheese is pretty strong which doesn't let you taste much else. Don't get me wrong I love blue cheese, but call me crazy but I love a nice hand made patty mixed with herbs with some quality cheddar or goats cheese or something, LTO, maybe some sauteed onions or avocado if I'm in the mood. I think maybe people are dumbstruck that you actually get a decent 't understand or appreciate it, but oh well. Guess some people like it. The decor is nice and the rest of the menu looks like it could be decent, but given my dissapointment with the burger I'm not sure I'll be back.",0
125366,1814,3.0,-1,2010-02-28,"After 2 years in NYC, I finally made it through the 1 hour wait for a table at Spotted Pig for their infamous burger.  What a let down!  What a disappointment!  They should change the menu to a bag of salt accented by a toasted buttery bun, a scoop of roquefort cheese (super salty), some burger on the side and a mountain of garlic-rosemary fries (which were tasty - and not as salty). Some context: Let it be known, I am a huge fan of the Shake Shack Burger as well as a delicious, freshly grilled burger in a sit down restaurant like Corner Bistro.  Like those on NY Magazine's Food Editorial board, I am also keenly aware that the best burgers are 80% lean, accompanied by lettuce, tomato, some mild cheddar cheese, and sandwiched between a toasted potato bun and served with shoestring french fries. So, overall it isn't worth the wait for this burger.  The ambience is very nice, the staff is good as well. Perhaps it was the salt-loving chef who was working this Sunday (Feb 27 around 2pm) or  perhaps this is really their style.  Either way, I'm definitely not going back there for a burger, but I'd give some of the other items on the menu a try.   I'm up for 2nd chances.   Lastly, How can this place really be a michelin star restaurant? According to NY Mag articles, they win for superior ingredients. Perhaps it is the high quality of their ingredients, like their salt?",0

I've gotta tell you, while the burgers and gnudi (pronounced nude-ee and therefore often referred to as naked gnocchi) are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the long waits and (hopefully) unintentional elbowing at the bar can be a bit vexing. The next time I head to Spotted Pig will be on a day I've opted to play hookie from work. While I love the bustling crowds when I'm on the prowl, the long waits for a table can be a real turn-off.

I saved half my burger for dinner the next day and was seriously upset when I realized I forgot to put in into the fridge after returning home in the wee hours of the morning.

61753,1814,4.0,-1,2014-11-01,"I hate any place that does not take reservations. I find it incredibly annoying and unnecessary. The hosts here are also annoying in a condescending/hispter kind of way. Also, the service is bad. The people that work here come off as if they feel like they are saving the world by working here. Other than this, the food is extremely delicious (so much so that it outweighs the bad service/experience otherwise). Obviously the food is very unhealthy, perhaps excessively so- one of those places where there is butter, salt, and fat added to anything and everything. I'm surprised there wasn't a stick of butter in my water. That said, it was one of the best tasting cheeseburgers I have had in my life. It was out of this world.",1

Best to arrive early and get yourself a table/spot at the bar before the place gets extremely busy. They don't take recommendations so it's a case of pitching up and chancing your luck. I was very lucky the host got me a spot at the bar and made sure I was looked after, I think she took pity on me as I was travelling alone, I ordered the burger which was incredible and a few cocktails, very reasonably priced too! I will definitely visit again when I return to New York.",1

The cocktails here are very delicious, which made the wait seems shorter.  Most of my friends tried their burgers and they were all very satisfied, I ordered the seafood, don't know why, it came out good as well. I know this supposed to be the west village gem, and I can finally check off my list !",1

They also have one of my favorite beers on tap (Old Speckle Hen) which is hard to come by. Ive also had the Branzino here, which i ordered by mistake one night. One of the best mistakes i could have made. If I ever stray away from the burger, I'll be sure to write about it.",1
125424,1814,4.0,-1,2014-08-30,"The wait was 1.5 hours but the bar vibe was really good. Good selection of beers, but wine lacked flavor during dinner. I wanted the skirt steak but notice d that no one had ordered it while we waited. EVERYONE has a burger. The corn soup was the best I have had in  a long time. Burger was very good which I had at medium. 2 floors of space. The worst thing about this place is that the bathroom temperature is like 100 degrees and soooooooooo small.",1
125425,1814,4.0,-1,2014-07-29,"I work pretty close and always were told about this place. Since it was my 7th year anniversary and I had 30 min break for lunch, I decided to try. The vibe, deco, ambience are very nice. However, lunch menu does not offer a lot of options. It was pretty hard to choose my plate. Prices are a little high for a fast lunch as well. I ordered this ricotta pasta with pesto sauce and it was surprisingly super good. My husband ordered the burger and was very good as well. French fries are a must try, specially with the sliced garlic they add. I was in a little rush and check took a while to be dropped. Service is very fine. Definitely I'll try dinner and brunch!!!",1

It's a gastropub so it's very small, but comfortable. We shared appetizers and small plates. The chicken liver on toast is very, very good, I loved it. We also got the Devils on Horseback which is a pickled pear in a prune wrapped by bacon. It was good, but too sweet for my own liking. I loved the gnudi with sheep's milk ricotta. It was so fresh. The pesto was absolutely perfect and it was not too heavy and not too light.",1

Our server, Will, was very kind and knowledgeable when it came to gluten allergies and the safest menu options. He did a wonderful job along with the fantastic hostess, who I also believe was a manager, who was full of spunk and life. Cons: The restaurant is very small and there is limited space for mingling upstairs. With that being said, a server upstairs, who I am told was named Sean, was very rude and did not acclimate to the crowded bar area well unlike other servers. He was very demanding and inappropriate to guests that were just trying to grab a drink at the bar during their hour and a half wait. Also, the wines by the glass are limited and on average are $15 or more so be prepared to spend  extra on wine if that is your drink of choice.",1

125435,1814,4.0,-1,2013-06-12,"Came here about a month ago with a buddy who was in NYC on business from out of town. I live here and had never been, so we thought we'd give it a shot. We both ordered the burger, as we heard it was the restaurants ""go-to"" menu item. I would give the burger a 3/5 -- definitely not the best burger I've ever had, but not the worst either. I can't remember exactly, but I think it cost ~$25, which is pretty standard for a nice burger at an NYC restaurant. All-in-all, I would come back, and would order the burger again. For those of you who are interested, the Spotted Pig is a ""sister restaurant"" of the Ace Hotel. In my opinion, the Ace Hotel's burger blows the Spotted Pig's away (it's a lamb burger vs. beef like @ Spotted Pig).",1
110919,1814,4.0,-1,2013-05-31,Shoe String Fries are awesome! Spotted Pig is totally worth the wait considering the line to dine at this place is somewhat long. However that shouldn't hinder you from enjoying this fine two floor gastropub since this place is cozy as well as small. I actually find this place amusing since there is a little quarter pocket of a dining area making it cozy and a lot more suitable to keep a distant from the second floor pub.,1
125436,1814,4.0,-1,2013-04-23,"Great place to sink a few beers - they have lots of great stuff on tap including the lovely Old Speckled Hen. We've never had any great issue with the no reservations thing. It's a nice place to hang out in 'til a table frees up which never seemed too long or traumatic. The staff are almost all great. And the food for the most part is spot on. Deviled eggs - check. Devils on horseback - get some. Chicken liver toast - delicious. The burger is good ? Waste of time in my book. So thin that by the time they hit your table they have lost their heat and are cold. What ever happened to good proper fat chips? This place if any, being English pub inspired, should sort those fries out. We'll always come back here.",1

April Bloomfield is the super talented chef behind the deliciousness of this gastro pub. The popularity of the Spotted Pig has started a whole trend of people milling towards gastro pubs in the city. This little bohemian spot in the West Village offers seasonal British and Italian dishes on its menu, which are adapted from popular pub food. Just try their killer Gnudi, which are these ""to die for"" dumplings made with sheep's milk ricotta. Their deviled eggs are divine as is their outstanding Banoffee pie for dessert. The Spotted Pig is just one of those places that you cannot get enough off. I think I can safely 'm hooked!!",1

Seriously the best entree I had ever ordered at a restaurant.  Steak cooked to perfection, amazingly seasoned beets and the horseradish cream topped it all off. I was tempted to lick the plate clean. My boyfriend ordered the chargrilled burger with roquefort and shoestrings. It was just okay. The cheese was a bit too strong and I felt that it overpowered  the entire burger.

I also enjoyed the burger. I had asked it to be cooked medium rare and it was done to perfection. Juicy and flavorful on a soft, buttery bun. The roquefort cheese added a nice pungent, sharp bite. My girlfriend enjoyed the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, as well. A pleasant dining experience with great service and a lively atmosphere.

125473,1814,4.0,-1,2007-03-06,"I'll make large exceptions for somewhere with so few options for vegetarians such as we when the food is as good as this. The place has the word 'pig' in it's title, not 'tofu'. So it would be particularly stony-hearted of me to withhold any praise based on that. The one thing that does catch your eye is the sign saying that it is licensed for 90-something people ""in the interests of safety"" or something. It *seemed* as if that was being flouted on this particular night, although that could be untrue, as they seemed to be having a meeting for agoraphobics anonymous (West Village branch). And the whole of West Village seems to be agoraphobic, what's more. But a good thing too, think of it as a test of character and discernment. I personally will gladly risk being crushed to death for their sheep's' cheese ricotta dish, the only veggie option on the menu, but frankly the only one I need. (However, if the chef does decide to stick one or two more choices on there, I won't complain.) Service is A1, brisk, timely, and I can't help but admire how swivel-hipped the wait staff are as they carry trays through the marauding hordes of clientele. The fact that the place is crowded doesn't seem to affect the experience, which is testimony to how slick the operation is. They don't take reservations, and quite right too. It would be like booking a spot in a rugby scrum. Wine list is extensive and covers just about all bases, with a better than usual European representation. The place seems to be loosely based on a British-style pub, but it's far too pleasant, amiable, high-end and non-violent to bear any close comparison. To sum up - if you want a quiet night with a sweetheart, this place would actually work, strangely. The fact it's so busy only adds to your anonymity. If you're bringing a party of 6 or more, it might be a little tricky judging from the glum expressions on the party of 6 waiting by the door - but I just don't think it's that kind of place.",1

An entree of veal breast stuffed with veal sausage did not quite deliver, however the cheese plate and ginger cake dessert were hits. The pub has large windows, lots of exposed wood, and atmospheric lighting - heavy curtains, drawn as end of night ""lockdown"" approached, were a particularly authentic touch.  Bottom line: The Spotted Pig offers food a cut above your average pub grub, ambiance in spades, and a friendly, easy-going welcome.",1

70650,1814,5.0,-1,2014-12-27,"So glad I found this place! The Spotted Pig is an awesome place to spend your evening. They don't take reservations (which in some ways is nice, you don't have to plan far in advance to come here). The kitchen opens for dinner around 5 or 5:30, so that's when my group got there to put our names down for a table. We were seated by around 6:15 or so. In the meantime we enjoyed some drinks at their bar. The menu changes every day, so they really think through their menu. We had their chicken liver on toast, squid soup (more squid than soup), crispy pig ear salad, seared mackerel with sweet potato mash & house cured pancetta, grilled skirt steak with delicata squash, hazelnuts, and yogurt dressing, and wild striped bass with roasted cauliflower. They err on the ""rare"" side of medium-rare, just FYI. Our waitress let us know this beforehand, so we ordered the steak medium and it ended up being what we considered medium-rare. Everything was amazing, well-prepared, fresh, good service, etc. The Spotted pig is laid back, cozy, and very welcoming. I look forward to coming back again!",1

Was traveling alone and had high recommendation from a very picky sibling that this was 'must do' so made a special trip here to eat dinner on my last night in NYC. Laid back vibe here but crowded which meant no tables so headed up to the 2nd floor bar. Not only did Alex make me two of the best 'spot on' cocktails I've ever had, he steered me to the perfect IPA and was very helpful in ordering dinner (as well as eating it, since he gave me a tip to mix the rillette so I didn't get a mouthful of duck fat instead of pate) Clearly, he cares about/has a passion for his work and I also observed him to take care of other parties around me in the same way and going the extra mile to give customers just what they wanted--even when that took quite awhile to tease out of them. I had a fabulous dinner where I felt relaxed and personally attended to (thx for the history lesson about Chartreuse btw!) despite dropping in on a very busy Sunday night. I even left with the exact recipe for my favorite drink--yay! Alex is a real gentleman and great at what he does--bravo to him and know that the bar upstairs is a fine place--perhaps even the best place--to spend your evening here.",1

The wait staff was very nice and helpfully explained some of the dishes for us.  We had a wonderful meal:  my daughter had the gnudi and I had the sausage (yes, the faggot with mashed potatoes).

They have some very tasty and very interesting appetizers. Try the deviled egg.  It sounds plain, but man, it is so damn good. The gnudi was SO GOOD.  The devils on horseback, OMG delicious. What a cool place.  Such great food, they definitely have a world-class chef working here, you can tell.  There are no reservations, so if you don't want to wait for a long time (1-2 hours), come early, and come before Thursday.  Even then, expect a wait of at least 45 minutes, but you can walk down to Hudson for a drink; I recommend a little tapas bar called Caliu, which has 2 different sangrias, and when we went there we got the BEST little cheese plate for free just by checking in with FourSquare.  It's totally worth the $6 or whatever it normally costs, it was really, really good.  There's also a cool little bookstore called BookMarc another block down on the corner of 11th and Bleecker.  There's lots of other places to check out, too, it's a great little neighborhood to walk around in.",1

The food is lovingly cooked and beautifully presented. The staff are courteous but not stuffy and always very helpful (as there is always at least two dishes I can't decide between).They also have a good knowledge of the food and wine. I pretty much inhale their rollmops, I've never found any more delicious. True, the wait is pretty long, the trick I've found is to get there nice and early (6.30/7 ish) put your name on the list and then head to the nice little wine bar down the road (Turks and Frogs) share a bottle of wine and some olives and The Spotted Pig will call when your table is ready.

During the summer I went, and I still maintain that I had the best meal I've ever had to date; a young rabbit stew with baby summer vegetables in a fennel cream sauce. It was amazing. Go.",1

Now, I've eaten grilled cheese sandwiches before, and I wasn't expecting much anything different. This sandwich, on the other hand, was hands down the best grilled cheese sandwich I'll ever have.  No doubt about it. In fact, to call it a grilled cheese sandwich is to do it injustice.  Two huge pieces of bread that are covered in some type of crispy/fried cheese, and a melted guyere cheese on the inside. I'm not even sure what the ingredients were, I just remember it was heavenly. Atmosphere: Awesome place to grab a beer and a bite.  Casual, cordial, homey, and outright awesome.  I'll be going back many, many times to come, considering its two blocks away.",1

Great, well what was I to find to eat since I had my heart set on that burger all the cab ride down. The server told us of a pork chop special so I ordered that. I kind of forget what the rest of our group ordered, but the meal was quite forgettable and it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out. There was one thing that wasn't forgettable and that was the vegetables that came with my pork chop came with a chili pepper from hell. If you know me, I can chew down a habanero without much of a fight. But that's if I'm expecting to eat one. Somehow, something like a habanero made it's way into my vegetables. It had to be unintentional so I let the server know. Don't make a special trip out here like I did.",0

I returned the meal ... The first time I've ever done that. The waiter was must apologetic and offered me something else but I declined ;  my appetite no longer. My partner ate the mackerel which was Ok . The pork wasn't listed on the bill at the end but all in all it was still disappointing.,0

We figured we would grab some drinks and wait inside, there were seats around ""the column"". There were some special beers listed on the board but I wanted some sort of a cocktail, so I asked to see a menu. So far so good. The people I was with decided to get something to drink, went up to the bar, came right back with drinks. I got my menu, decided what I wanted, went up to the bar said hi to the bartender while looking right at him, then he turned around and started talking to some of the people seated at the bar, OK,I'll wait until he's done, he can see me he's turned to my side, but then turns his back to me and talks to some other people. OK, they were there 1st maybe they asked for more drinks. no, he's not making anything. He rings up a tab, OK I get that too. But now I've been there about 10-15 min. Finally he turns towards me I ask for my drink, he makes it, a waiter comes up he makes a drink for him and then rings me up. I don't know why it took so long, it did seem as if I was being ignored, but hey I'll let it go I finally have my drink and it's good! We get seated, mind you the place is small and busy but it was comfortable, I didn't feel crowded, so that's a plus too. I probably should have looked at the menu before hand but didnt. So I am between 2 pork dishes. I ask the waiter, who was very friendly, great service which he would pick, he says they are both good but one of the dishes  is a cold dish so I go with the sizzling sisig. I really should have known what it was before I ordered it, and that's on me. There is a lot of gristly bits in it, it's the nature of the dish. Had I known I would have ordered something else, BUT it was very flavorful and the meaty bits were good, I just couldn't eat the gristle. But here's the kicker 1 of us is vegetarian, so she asks him for a recommendation, guess what he is a vegetarian too!! so how did he know both pork dishes were good???? I don't know, wish he would have told me. Anyway we got the deviled eggs, they were really really good. Someone had the burger, said it was good, I tried the potatos that came with it, they were ok, more like chips than fries. I guess my expectations were too high for what the whole experience was. Some good service,the  food was good, even the prices weren't bad. But I guess I expected more than I got in some way.",0

Service was pretty good and it wasn't that crowded so we could hang out for awhile.  I thought overall it was solid and the good way to start the trip.  However, it is a little pricey for just solid.  Lots of other places we went in New York stood out a lot more, so I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but will definitely be happy to eat here again if it happens.  I think I just had too high of expectations.",0

30414,1814,4.0,1,2014-12-29,"This place has been on my list for so long, and I finally went last weekend. I decided that I wanted to try The Spotted Pig for brunch for my first time. Upon arrival, of course there was a wait. Luckily we nabbed a spot by the window. It was a little tight but perfect for the two of us. Unfortunately, we had to watch trash being taken out and cooks bringing food in and out, but given that there was no wait time involved, we counted our blessings and were grateful to eat soon. We started with bloody marys, which come with some nice pickled veggies, and some deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were a little oily albeit delicious. We ordered the infamous roquefort burger with shoestring fries and knew we wanted to share, but we wanted a little something else. Our waitress recommended the burrata with roasted wild mushrooms to start. Best. Decision Ever. The burrata was soft and delicious, and the wild mushrooms were so aromatic with the perfect hint of acid to bring a bright flavor. We had ordered the burger medium rare, and unfortunately The Spotted Pig loses a star for serving us a medium well burger. Huge pet peeve of mine, especially when you're paying over $20 for a burger. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious, and we're not the type to complain to our server (considering how long things can take in NYC). While the first couple of bites of shoestring fries are crisp and delicious, when you get a huge pile, the bottom is always lackluster by the time you get to it. All in all, the burrata saved the meal and had us wanting to come back to The Spotted Pig to try the lesser known items on the menu.",1

We walked in a few minutes later only to be made to stand for half an hour despite there being several empty tables because the hostess said the kitchen wouldn't take more than a few orders at once. She didn't seat us and allow us to order a drink while we waited - or even look at us once in the half hour we were hanging around. When we were finally seated, we ordered two burgers right away. They arrived 1.5 hours later. Grand total spent at the Spotted Pig: 2 hours and 45 minutes. Wait time: two hours. Hostess: unfriendly and snooty. Food: delicious.",0

The issue I had was with the front of house - from the surly/smug hostess, the extra half hour we waited for a table over the quoted 45 minute wait, and then a ridiculous wait for the food to arrive. I am fairly Zen like when it comes to being patient in these situations and I'm definitely no stranger to a long wait in a restaurant, but I got the distinct impression that this is a place that is resting on its laurels.",0

First, I had to wait for almost three hours for a table that was supposed to be available in 1:30. Second: When they finally took me to my table, well, it was better if I had stayed in the bar. The table for 3 people was the size of a table for one, it was ridiculously small, the chairs didn't provide any comfort and my chair was located beside a wall in diagonal, so I couldn't even sit properly! Just in part of it! Third: we order 3 cosmopolitans to relax while waiting another long time for our burguers. U$14,00 for a little glass of drink that tasted like pink lemonade with alchool, no sugar! Doesn't even resemble a cosmopolitan, pure lime!

Well I think I have a different idea of what a good burger is supposed to be (I still think the best burger I've had in NYC is from Paul's Da Burger Joint, and that Minetta Tavern's Black Label burger is hard to enjoy as a 'burger', more like a steak with bread)... I enjoyed the small plates my party tried: chicken liver toast, deviled eggs, and squid stew. However, the famous burger was a huge letdown. One possible mistake is that we ordered the burgers medium rare. Spotted Pig seems to overly grind its meat, and the result of having it not cooked enough gave the burgers the texture reminiscent of fish paste. So if you're going to try this place, have it cooked longer than medium rare.",0

However, once we arrived and had ordered, it took 45 minutes to receive our food-all of us had ordered burgers so did not expect it to take so long for something so simple. Furthermore, all of our burgers had been ordered medium, and they were all barely cooked rare! The food was also not warm. Mine especially, was cold. I spoke to the waiter, and he grudgingly took it away and I can only presume put it in a microwave, as I revived the same, half eaten burger back about 10 minutes later. It was slightly warmer. On raising the issues of the cold, undercooked burgers to the staff member, the only response I got was a mumbled ""sorry"" before he ran away.

There.   No lie, I took a half day from work to get a haircut in the city, and afterwards, proceeded to walk 16 blocks to 314 W. 11th St.  It was a cold afternoon but I didn't give a rats ass.  I helped myself to the bar, and ordered their signature burger topped with Roquefort cheese and shoe string fries from the very accommodating and friendly bartender.  This burger was UNREAL; one of the best I've ever had, and is arguably tops on my Burger Bucket List.  It was juicy as a mofo yet strangely enough, none of it leaked out and it all stayed within the burger.  The Roquefort cheese (a type of blue cheese) was the perfect combination, and it only enhanced the burger's flavor.

It came with two pieces of bread with a slab of liver on top. It was so savory and it was the perfect bike to start the meal. Another appetizer we got was the pickled vegetables. We also got the deviled eggs and my friend said it was the best of egg egg he's ever had. We got the Dutch baby, chowder, burger, and the chef's special spicy chicken. Everything was exceptional. My favorite was the burger. The burger was about an inch thick and so savory. I loved it. Shoestring fries on the side was a great touch. I would suggest getting here right when it opens that way you won't have to wait an hour to an hour and a half to get inside. Overall, my friends and I loved the place and we highly recommend it!",1

There was a wait, so we put our name in and went to another bar in the interim. This was easy given the multitude of places nearby. Once we sat down, I felt obliged to sample the famous burger. The patty was large and a perfect pink medium. Then, it is topped blue cheese. I am a blue cheese girl, so it hit the spot. The shoestring fries were crispy, salty, and plentiful - an excellent addition. I opt for the Belgian presentation when it comes to eating fries, so was a little disappointed to learn that they did not have mayo. All the same, The Spotted Pig lived up to the hype!",1

Not amazingly outgoing, but nice enough. I had the oysters, which were excellent. Mignonette was good, though I did miss having cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish. Entree was the burger and fries. Good burger, but not the best as many seem to think. I ordered medium rare, and for medium well at first, but they got that fixed pronto. A+ for that. Very tasty, I liked the bleu cheese, but given the size and the fact it was medium rare, I was shocked at the lack of juiciness. Maybe I'm spoiled from the days of Ray's Hellburger outside of DC, but not enough juice, and not enough flavor in the patty itself to be among the best. The fries were excellent. Like, can't get them into my face fast enough excellent. The deep fried garlic and rosemary really made them. The small plates and apps I saw other people eating looked great. I'd go back.",1

Well my son said he wanted to explore the West Village and I agreed.  I told him to find somewhere to eat, he found here.  I saw $$$ and thought ""he couldn't find somewhere cheaper"" lol I went along with it. ::::::::::LOCATION:::::::::: Located in-between the heart of the West Village shops and the water is The Spotted Pig.  You will pass a plethora of other eateries, schools, and businesses along your journey down 11th Street.  You will know when you arrive to this quaint highly decorated establishment on Greenwich. :::::::::ATMOSPHERE:::::::::: Small.  Packed. Worth every minute waiting.  Its pub-like, but with a feel of class and fine dining (as fine as one could be in a Pub).  There is a bar area, and seating upstairs (I didn't see that area). ::::::::::FOOD:::::::::: 5 Stars.  So by now you have read the reviews, everyone talks about the B!!!!!!!!!! Burger - OMG, one of the BEST burgers Ive ever had.  Topped with Salty Roquefort Cheese and a Medium Rare patty.  No extra trendy ingredients necessary.  Everything you need is already on the burger.  The fries are thin, crispy and drizzled with herbs and oil.  Perfectly seasoned and digested. Pecan Pie - I love Pecan Pie, but I rarely order it.  Most places put too much of that sugary filling and not enough nuts.  NOT HERE.  The amount of nuts and filling is perfectly portioned.  I loved it.  I still love it.  Order this if you are having a sweet tooth after dinner.

125590,1814,4.0,1,2014-11-28,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love the food at The Spotted Pig. That alone will keep me coming back! The main draw back is the fact that they do not take reservations so you have to come in and hope for the best. The other draw back is the bar areas, both downstairs and upstairs, are so small and cramped that waiting for your table becomes unpleasant. Granted, I'm at an age when this type of bar scene just is not appealing anymore but still it definitely detracts from the overall experience of The Spotted Pig. Once you've been seated at your table, its a much more enjoyable atmosphere. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly and prompt. They don't rush you along in anyway, which is great. The fact that the tables are rather close together can be great (we engaged with the people on both sides of us a little and it was wonderful) or it can be not so great if you want a more intimate evening (if you do, don't go to The Spotted Pig). But it's all about the food! Great British fare that is exciting and new and delicious. The Devils on Horseback were amazing (dates, wrapped in bacon): sweet and salty with a hint of heat from red chilis. Also love the Deviled Eggs. I had the Pork Rilliette: pork shoulder with white wine and garlic and duck fat! So rich and complex and one of the best I've had. I followed that with the Guinea Hen they had on special. Fantastic as well, though maybe a touch salty. We will return and brave the wait for a table because the food is that good!",1

125595,1814,5.0,1,2014-11-25,Chargrilled burger and shoestring fries are on point. The burger has a nice full meaty flavor and the cheese makes it a very dense bite. At times the flavors are almost too rich as it seems to be with every dish in this place often bordering on too salty when earn together. The gnocchi plate is among the best offerings here tasting very smooth and buttery and the chicken liver toast is also a delightful dish. The seating is a bit cramped but the atmosphere is definitely very hip and I saw Anja Rubik dining upstairs so don't be surprised to see supermodels dining here. It was packed even on a Monday night. Get here before 7 and you won't have to wait for a table. Also a bit of a pain of the ass to get here since there's no subway stops nearby.,1

We showed around 6:30 on a Friday and it was an hour to an hour and a half wait. Thankfully, they have a texting service, so went around the corner to the historic (cash only) White Horse Tavern for a drink while we waited. Located on the corner, the building is nondescript, so be on the lookout for a tiny pig hanging out over the doorway. Walk in and you are greeted and seated when your table is ready. The seating is a bit cramped, with my wife seated pretty closely and intimately to the table behind her. The service was good, though, and despite the volume, was quick. We started out with Devils on Horseback (prunes wrapped in bacon) and an unlisted beef medallions in a cheese sauce. Our friend got the Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage and my wife and I each for the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries. The gnudi was packed and was very tasty and the burgers were cooked perfectly with addictive shoestring fries. So aside from the cramped space we got shoved in to, this place was worth the wait.

Tried the burger, chicken liver toast, cocktails, etc. Closest analogy I can give is the Silvertone Bar in Boston -- loved by students and young professionals especially for low prices, fantastic service, and quality food mainly due to smart cooking (as opposed to lux ingredients).

It's not just any gastropub though. The Spotted Pig pushes out comfort food, British style. Chicken Liver Toast -- For all you Asians out there, think of the pate that comes in the banh mi. You'll have to get use to the muddy-like texture but once you get past that, it's all smooth sailing. The crunchy toast is a great complement to the mush-like chicken liver. The flavor was ultimately very mellow. It's a great precursor to the main event. Chargrilled Burger -- A crowd favorite. Heck, Google their famous burger and see pages and pages of sites describing their infatuation and even recipes in hopes to replicate the item at home. The patty was remarkably thick, easily one of the thickest burger patties I've ever had. The bun was heavy and firm, somewhat crunchy around the edges. The one ingredient that completely changed the burger was the Roquefort Cheese. It's a sheep milk blue cheese which altered the taste of the burger. I, for one, am not a fan of blue cheese. It makes me think that the cheese is far past the level of expired and, in the end, makes me feel ill. All I could taste was the cheese. It really took away from the flavor of the meat. To each their own.   The shoestring fries were great, tasted like chips to me. Make sure you dip it in tons of ketchup! The restaurant seems to draw in a lot of celebrities. Supposedly, Jay Z co-owns the joint. I even sat next to Aziz on my last visit!",0

It is excellently casual despite the Manhattan address and seemed like a refreshing mix of ages and 'm sure there are casual star sightings here if that's an important factor. Wait quotes seem to be blown wildly out of proportion although that's probably better than the opposite. Arriving on an early Sunday evening, ""over an hour"" became 25 minutes and I was conveniently texted and told to return within 10 minutes. If the weather was nicer and one organized a shopping trip or even just a stroll through the cobblestone streets in the West Village it wouldn't even be that large of a factor. It is, however, cramped. In order to sit down I had to pull the table out and my back was uncomfortably against a row of potted plants. I'm not sure if they really are just that hard up for space (as the bathroom is also very cramped) or it's an intentional ploy to turn tables sooner. Unfortunately the burger with roquefort and shoestring fries ($21), the primary claim to fame, ? I enjoyed it but I barely remember it in retrospect. I'm not sure why the queues form here. The coziness is offset by the close quarters, it is a bit loud, and the prices don't seem justified for the quality.

61169,1814,3.0,1,2014-11-09,"Food (4/5)   Decor (3/5)   Service (2/5)   Value (2/5) Sadly, this one fell short of expectations. I was originally very excited about eating at The Spotted Pig after I heard its chef, April Bloomfield, had won a James Beard award. Fast forward to 10:45am in early November, I was standing outside the restaurant in a line with quite a number of other people waiting for the restaurant to open at 11am. Given that this restaurant does not take reservations, you have to get in line before it opens to guarantee yourself a seat. We were quickly seated upstairs and ordered our food. By around 11:15am, we received our chicken liver toast (appetizer). The dish was quite delicious (provided that you like chicken liver to begin). However, I was a little put off by the presentation of the dish (and being someone who grew up eating all sorts of organs, I'm not one to be put off by ). It literally looked like dung on toast. I'm not sure this can be helped too much since chicken liver looks like that, but maybe some greenery as a garnish would have helped a bit. As we happily devoured our chicken liver toast, we eagerly awaited our main food to arrive. All around us, tables were gradually getting seated (I think they might make people stand around at the bar for a while before they seat them so that they can stagger food service). By around noon, we were getting a little antsy and main courses had begun to arrive for tables around us even though we were the first party seated in our area and also the first to order. We asked the waiter about our food, and he told us it was the next to come out and that they put tickets with appetizers to the back of the line after the appetizer comes out. This seems a little idiotic to me, but moral of the story is, don't order , ask for them with your main course. Regardless, our food was not the next to come out. Or even next after that. By around 12:15pm, about an hour after we ordered, our food finally came out. From a food perspective, the restaurant was actually pretty good. The seafood chowder and pumpkin pancake were both delicious and unique. However, the portion sizes were on the smaller side, and at $15-20 per entree, I think a bit overpriced. The shoestring fries were good as well. As a personal preference, I would have preferred them have a fleshier (soft) inside and crispy outside, but these shoestring fries are thoroughly fried and basically just crunchy. They're still well-seasoned and delicious, but don't expect what you would normally think of as a , the restaurant would deserve 4 stars for the food. However, the slow service and lack of value are a little bit hard to overlook in this case. Since I went here, I've had conversations with other people about this restaurants and all opinions seem to be positive on food, but quite negative on service. It was worth the experience to go once, but this restaurant isn't getting added to my brunch rotation.",0

As in I might have fallen asleep cradling my Britta filter against my chest. Is this horrible thirst worth it? Yes. If you like your burger like you like your (wo)men - strong, intense Roquefort cheese, totally bare bones with no lettuce or tomato or onion. You don't really need much else, but I personally liked scooping the little fried garlic nubs and rosemary leaves, and stuffing them into the burger. Such a fat kid.

42372,1814,3.0,1,2014-10-29,"I came here on a Saturday during brunchy/dinnerly hour as a friend was craving for meat (umm actually she craves for meat all the time). The wait was still quite a bit even at 3PM --- whoa I guess it is really THAT good. The place is bigger than it seems from outside and has a homely feel to it. The menu was pretty simple and there wasn't that much burger selections as I thought (in fact, there's only ONE burger). I was under the impression that this place has knock out burger --- so I had always thought this was a burger place. They do have a good amount of cocktail selections though - in case you're wondering. I did end up ordering the burger with a request to make it medium well while my friend did the same but had the meat cooked in medium. We also ordered the devil egg. It took awhile for the food to come (even the devil eggs) - unsure why but for sure the anticipation rose to the roof. When the food came through I took my bite and then--------------------- ; I mean this is a dish that is not really likely to fail to begin with so you can only elevate by deciding what to mix with the yolk. In TSP's case, it was vinegar and mayo but that's about it (at least that was all I could tasted). It wasn't really much of a surprise. I've made devil eggs more interesting than this (it was still praised to this day by friends even though it was made 2 yrs ).  But whatever, it was still pretty appetizing. Now the , it was two buns + hamburger meat + blue cheese sauce and that was the end of the story. I guess you can argue a good burger doesn't need all that unnecessary decorations - yes but I like my burger to be a bit more diverse. On top of all ? I think so. I do give them the benefit of doubt as I didn't get to try anything else on the menu but given that people have been saying how good their burger is suppose to be, it was a bit of a let down. Will I go back? Only if I don't have to wait. Side note: My friend and I both thought our meat was more raw that what we imagined to be. If you are for one who likes your meat on the cooked side but not so cooked that the meat lose its tenderness, be sure to let your server know that you want it between medium well to well done. I know it sounds like a request only an annoying customer would make but this is to ensure you don't freak out when the burger comes.",0

26272,1814,4.0,1,2014-10-26,"KenScale: 8.5/10 The Spotted Pig is probably the most well-known gastropub in NYC, period. Getting a reservation at this restaurant helmed by chef April Bloomfield is notoriously difficult at this restaurant that doesn't take reservations (last time I checked in, I was given a wait time of two hours, so I didn't get nearby since then knowing that, although I would be more than happy to wait, my friend(s) who join me would probably lose patience). Lately, I had a opportunity to go on a pretty early dinner, so I decided to use that opportunity to finally check this restaurant out. The dinner time starts at 5:30 , and I walked in for some beer and wrote my name down at 5 (The Breslin) other than their famed lamb burger, so I tried to manage my expectations, Fortunately, there were truly outstanding winners coming out from the kitchen, and the best dish wasn't the famed burger. I started out with a bunch of bar snacks. Deviled egg was tasty and so were the greasy devils on horseback wrapped in bacon. My winner, though, was the chicken liver toast that was absolutely delicious with great balance of flavor. While everyone is talking about the burger here and all the tables I've seen ordered at least one (more on the burger later), my favorite dish of the night was the simple-looking yet truly outstanding sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter and crispy sage. The ricotta inside was just pure decadence and I can't stop thinking about that dish with soft texture with bold flavor. Yes, the burger was also great, but I think it could've tasted even better without the roquefort cheese whose strong flavor somewhat undermined the juicy texture of the meat. While I understand where the hype is coming from, I wouldn't call this burger the best thing that happened to NYC. I was beyond stuffed by the time I finished the burger, but wanted to try at least one dessert. I'm so glad I did because the seasonal tart that came with bananas was one of the best tarts I've had in a while, with awesome flavor working very well with the silky smooth bananas without being overly sweet. Your best bet to get seated at The Spotted Pig is to show up 1-2 minutes before 5 , write your name down and hope for the best when the dinner service starts at 5:30 ! I liked the charming, divey gastropub feel of the restaurant with tons of pig figures on the wall. The restaurant has a full bar with nicely prepared classic cocktails (my favorite was Manhattan), so either go with some cocktails or brews to wash down the food. The Spotted Pig certainly lived up to its expectations, and I'll certainly come back next time I want to have a casual pub food night with bold flavor and skillful execution. When you go there, though, be prepared to walk on your way home.",1

36330,1814,2.0,1,2014-10-13,"Came here on a quest to find a burger in NYC that beats shake shack. According to the reviews, this burger is HEAVELY. I don't mind waiting for good 's super difficult getting in and out of the tables and you're up close and personal to your dining neighbors/can hear all their life problems/whatever intimate conversation they're having and think you can't hear. If you have to go to the bathroom and you're sitting on the inside, be prepared to inconvenience everyone and move out slowwwlyy. Anyway, all this would be fine if the burger was amazing, but it was not. We got the skirt steak and the famous burger with shoestring fries to share. There was a 40 minute wait for the burger.. but no worries, we already waited 90 mins. The skirt steak came out first and it was actually cooked very tenderly and flavorful. It came with some sort of butter/cream cheese and I happily cleaned up the plate. After another 20 minutes.. the burger came out and as I , I don't like blue cheese and there was some kind of blue cheese spread which I wasn't a fan of (and scraped it off). The shoestring fries were annoying to eat but it was not awful. I made sure my last bite was the skirt steak and not the mediocre, unimpressive burger. We got the creme caramel (basically flan.. why didn't they just call it flan) for dessert. This was pretty good, but almost like any other flan I've had. Hard to mess it up. Oh, idk if it was just the day I was there but I think the bathroom is literally a sauna. If you plan on taking #2, then make sure you bring a towel in there cause you'll have to wipe up sweat afterwards. You could barely MOVE. Not a fan at all. Why was the burger so overrated?? I know this is NYC, but why was everything so squished together?? I think you can probably get rid of a table or two and make the bathroom a little bit bigger.

My wife and I were in New York to celebrate our 5th anniversary, and The Spotted Pig was our first stop. The stereotype of the New York bartender making known his or her silent contempt for the unhip tourist hailing from suburbia cast a long shadow over our expectations, and we were both dreading the moment when we'd be called out by a native for a word or gesture betraying our cultural naiveté.  Of course, this never happened -- the people we met in New York were all very nice, courteous and accommodating.  But Henry was exceptional in this regard.  Not only does he make a terrific cocktail while manning a full bar on his own, but he's also a very companionable presence, and made us feel extremely welcome while we dined at the bar.

The atmosphere is also very accommodating whether a date night or just a time to go out with friends or on your own. Don't recommend it for children, just because the spaces are tight.

This was my first time having sisig, and it was delicious. Greasy in all the right ways. This is great food to accompany a few beers. My gf ordered the frittata and was not as pleased as i was with my dish. When i go back i am trying their burger which i have heard so many good things about over the years. ENJOY!!!",1

Just simple great dishes. everyone gets the Grilled Burger, but the veggies are what stand out here. If you see the Radish Salad w/ basil, arugula, and Parmesan. ORDER IT! If you see the eggplant or chicken liver toast.. ORDER IT.  Try everything.. except the Broccoli Rabe. Unfortunately mine was too oily and over cooked. A, But overall it's always tasty. This restaurant is a West Village Gem.",1
107401,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-17,I checked out this place last Saturday. So much fun! The bartender was super cool and the drinks were perfect! Got the famous burger with fries. AMAZING! SO FREAKIN GOOD! The place is pretty small but definitely worth the hype.,1
125651,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-16,"The Spotted Pig offers some amazingly fresh plates. I came here for brunch with my girlfriend the other day and was very pleased. The food was very good and the atmosphere was super trendy. Although the prices of the brunch drinks were a bit expensive, the food and the atmosphere makes up for it. Please check out my video review on my YouTube Channel! ",1
14306,1814,2.0,1,2014-09-13,"Servers were nice and efficient but the foods were underwhelmed. We didn't understand the hype. Is that because we didn't drink? Oysters with Mignonette ($36 for12) - The oysters at The Lobster Place in Chelsea Market is so much better and many to choose from, and pretty tasty even though I'm standing to eat. Steamed Mussels - another disappointment. The Thai broth didn't make me want to soak up with a bread. How mussels could be tasteless. I guess no seafood on Monday applies here. I want to believe it was their worst day but I felt bad for my friends from Tokyo to treat me for this lunch. The famous burger - perfectly cooked, medium. It was good but not that special especially for the price. It was good as Umami Burger except the price, $21 vs $15.5 (Classic $12 + fries $3.5) and you get your choice of fries. To my surprise, I did enjoyed the string fries with rosemary. Cuban sandwich ($19) -I read a good review but what we got was just okay, nothing very special. Tasty Prosciutto de Parma and the aged gruyere didn't help this gamey pork that was in the sandwich. Usually acidity from piickles help  a bit but not this one. Crème Caramel ($9) - everything we had, so far, were below 4.5 start so we didn't expect much from the dessert but it was excellent. We all loved this gelatinous Spanish-like firmed custard pudding with a light caramel sauce. We did not understand why we needed to wait for a table even the place wasn't packed for early Monday lunch. We waited outside for good 30 minutes but no one check us but we noticed may customers were showing up. I found that waiting outside was not a good idea because people after us got their table before us. I checked the name list that was left unattended and the name after us were erased. I suggest do not wait for your table outside. Big group of French tourists next to our table were waiting for their food and they were very chatty, high energy and being very French. The time we were about to leave, I noticed how very quiet the table got. The excitement has left the table and eating quietly, not like French anymore.",0

But putting things in perspective - the menu items are pretty good - but a) the burger is not the best burger in the world  and b) if you compare the dishes to restaurant quality - it's ok. Certain dishes could use a little refinement and little less butter.   Space wise, pretty cool on the inside, but not very comfortable. The bathrooms are literally a sauna since they're above the kitchen.",1
62308,1814,5.0,1,2014-09-08,"The burger IS as good as the hype has made it out to be. Medium rare perfection. The shoestring fries on the other hand, are not my favorite - they get cold too quickly because they are chopped so thin. Great presentation but scored lower on for practicality. Great rustic decor and fun hipster vibe. Must check it out!",1

I guess it's not on the menu anymore, but it used to be so if you ask for it, they probs know how to make it. Just a hint of sweetness, the perfect kick for an aftertaste, and boozie just the way I like it. My friend and I just hung out upstairs in the bar area. The ambiance was super chill and laid back. I loved it. We didn't have to shout at each other over any music, so that was a plus. Definitely down to get ratchet here. And drink jalapeno margaritas all night long.",1

27035,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-03,"The infamously best burger IS good. I ordered it medium rare, it literally melted in my mouth, as good as a straight burger can get. About this place: - Long wait. Avg. dinner waiting time 1.5-2 hours. After dropping by to leave names, went to a bar nearby for an hour and came back, waited for another hour. But all good restaurant in this neighborhood are like this. It's just a matter if the food is worth the wait at the end of the day. (= You can leave your cell number, they will call your phone when you're up. - Touristy: I'm not particularly fond of the decoration. Also, there're a lot of tourists dining here. So even though the place is big (2-levels, bathroom on both floors), it's still packed all the time. - Service: is quick, good and welcoming. - Burger: it's good by all means. BUT, the blue cheese was very  intense, which overwhelmed the burger. The burger had no salad, so expect, literally, bread+intense blue cheese+burger+shoestring fries. To be honest, after 2 hour's waiting time and some drinks, I was more frustrated than excited to try out this place. With all the tourists and people drinking/talking loud, I just wanted to eat and leave. Though, now I think back, the burger is definitely one of the best I've ever tasted. So be prepared to be frustrated at the beginning, but you will have good food and a good time! ;) a happy ending!",1
125654,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-02,"I have been to the spotted pig many many times. It's a great place to go for happy hour, for burgers, The rosemary fries, Great beer selection, wonderful ""The Nudies"". I don't enjoy the average wait time for table however, and they serve an extremely limited menu during the day. Only real time to truly eat there is from 5:30 PM on. The kitchen is closed from 5 PM to 5:30 PM, so that is a great time to come to The Pig for a few ;-)",1

Yummy Burger, average size,  but way overpriced at $21.00. I expected that, But I also expected better service. Very nice guy at the front, but then spoiled when taken upstairs to an aloof waitress who clearly didn't want to be there. From our first communication with her, we didn't want to be either. WON'T be going back.",0
124998,1814,3.0,1,2014-09-02,"Call me the odd ball but I didn't LOVE the burger! Thought it was good and worth the try but won't be craving it. Pros and Cons: 1. Burger is MASSIVE. So is the bun. It's meat, cheese, bun.  - Personally, I felt the meat could have used more seasoning and the patty could have been smaller (I don't eat a lot of meat so I may be biased, however my husband who does had the same comment) - Way too much bread - Too much cheese! It was a very salty intense cheese (which I usually love) but it overpowered the burger 2. Shoestring fries with fried garlic chips and fried rosemary were awesome but over salted. I did eat pretty much of all them. And would do so again if I went back. Cocktails were tasty but standard pricing for the area. Deviled eggs: awesome. You will wait half your lifetime for a table, but if you can snag a seat at the bar, go for it. The staff, while busy, was lovely- especially the bartender. Very cool experience, I'd recommend it to knock it off the NYC list.",0
6532,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-02,"Yes, I'm definitely a fan and would dine more often if the wait wasn't outrageous. We came here on a Friday night (past 10:30pm) and had to wait two hours until our party of five were seated. I'm glad there kitchen is open until 2am. Since I hate waiting I am not sure if would endure 2 hours again unless its for a special occasion. All the food was great and the spotted pig deserves the hype. If you're reading this review or dining here I assume you already have heard really good things about the restaurant already. We got a lot of the dishes and below are the ones i remember and would get again. Devils on horseback Chicken liver toast Sheep's milk ricotta Gnudi Monk-fish Burger with fries Note about the burger- it is very flavorful and rich. The cheese is really strong. Also, depending on what type of fry person you are you can hate or love the french fries. Service and drinks were good and there was a lot of charm to the location. Definitely a place to dine at if you want to possibly run in to someone famous or dine in an intimate restaraunt.",1
11023,1814,3.0,1,2014-09-01,"I got there at noon on Labor Day. Even though lunch starts at 12pm, I overheard there was a 45 minute wait for a table. I chose to eat at the bar even though the wait was also 45 minutes until my burger finally arrived. There was plenty of time to listen to Duran Duran and other tunes. I had lots of shoestring fries with a side of a little burger and bun. Sure it was thick but so small. I had to look between the buns to make sure there was a burger there. No onions, no lettuce nor tomato. Whatever sauce that was used tasted good but not worth the $22 spent on it. The shoestring fries are awkward to eat. I was wondering do I use a fork or my hands. I declined the bottle of ketchup because there's no conceivable way to dip the super thin fries in it. The bartender was pretty cool and I liked how everyone automatically got a glass of water right away. It was still an adventure that I'm glad I made. I'm just glad I didn't make any further plans that day.",0
66974,1814,4.0,1,2014-09-01,"What a nice little place in the West Village! It's a corner restaurant with ivy on the outside walls and pig-themed trinkets and decorations all around the inside. It's a tight fit on the inside, but it's better described as cozy than cramped. Be warned though, they don't take reservations so you'll have to put your name on the list, and the list gets long fast. It's worth the wait though, so grab a drink at the bar upstairs or at a place around the corner and come back excited. Culinary execution is the name of the game and The Spotted Pig does not disappoint. I mean, just look at the grill marks on top of the burger bun! Order the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries and you're in for a real treat. The patty is perfectly grilled and is well paired with the right amount of ""stink"" from the blue cheese. Depending on whether or not you like blue cheese, you'll know immediately if this is the right burger for you. Personally, I love it. Let's not forget about those shoestring fries now - a gorgeous heap of aromatic bliss. Fried rosemary and garlic chips make these insanely delicious. So, what are you waiting for? Get in line!",1

19800,1814,3.0,1,2014-08-29,"I went there yesterday and got the burger with fries. I enjoyed the Shoestring fries a lot and really had to stop myself from eating double portions (afterall, I did go there for the fries) The fries were seasoned with tiny fried garlics strips as well as rosemary (no wonder it was so tasty). The burger was cooked just right (medium) so it was juicy but I didn't enjoy it as much because it had blue cheese instead of American or Swiss. I didn't read the description so it was my fault . If I had known there was blue cheese, I wouldnt have gotten it. Blue cheese has a very very strong taste; it overpowered my burger. I tried scraping it off and put more ketchup; failed. Well, at least I had good fries. Service was slow but very courteous. This is a popular place so I'm glad I tried it. I heard their muscle were good, maybe I should've tried that. I don't know if I would want to wait another hour to be seated again . The wait wasn't bad since the location is good.

The second time was a weeknight so the wait was only about 39 minutes. The place is small so expect to be intimate with your neighbors if not crowded. The staff is very nice without being overbearing. However, to my surprise there was only one type of burger on the menu and the cheese option was only that one. Granted, the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly, but the cheese wasn't my cup of tea. Too much like Gorgonzola. Overall I enjoyed the experience. But I wouldn't say the best burger in the city.",0

We ended up trying to rub the salt off of our fries so they would be edible but there was nothing we could do about the burgers. We ended up downing 5 bottles of water to wash down the salty mess. The deviled eggs we got for appetizers were good but for the price you would think they would give you at least two eggs!",0

How freaking rude! And this is suppose to be a top notch institution in the village. I wanted to bounce but my guest really wanted to eat here. We finally had space to enter the bar area and had a couple of drinks before hand, since the wait was set for 1hr. The hostess comes up to me and annoyingly can not believe I was telling the truth that I had a party of three. My friends looked at her in disbelief and I went New York on her. She immediately found us a table. Anyway on to the food, service was horrible, beyond poor, and finally got to try ""one of the best burgers"" in nyc supposedly, actually for $25 it's one of the worst. Overwhelmed with blue cheese you could not taste the meat at all! And the fries, oh the fries, I wanted to kill whoever decided that slicing the thinnest French fries into a stack of hay was a tasteful and good idea. It was a hell of an experience and by the way don't waste your time on a burger there if that's what your going for, just head over to CORNER BISTRO down the block. You won't be disappointed.",0

We weren't too hungry so ordered their chicken liver toast and a dozen oysters. We were kind of oblivious that their burgers were their signature dish but their chicken liver toast was the best I've ever had. It had this wonderful flavor, great consistency and the toast had the perfect crunch to go with it. After a summer in nyc eating all the great food places, this chicken liver toast still ranks very high up on my list. The oysters were also very tasty and shucked properly. Their onion mignonette enhanced the flavor of the oysters instead of covering it up like cocktail sauce does. tl;dr Get their chicken liver toast. Come with a small party.",1
21014,1814,2.0,1,2014-08-24,The spotted pig was always on the presumptuous side but that didn't mean you couldn't go there to enjoy a nice afternoon or evening without much ado. But in line with its father Shawn Carter's success the pig in the last couple of years seemed to have shed its spots and put on instead a glamorous regalia of stars. The staff is stuffy and the place is constantly crowded with the national lampoon's vacation club ready to rub on a little bit of that glitzy porky stardom. The burger is still good and the fries yummy but a platter of tiny vegetables for 27U$D knocked the left size of our vegetarian brain out forcing us to look for the hidden steak or a secret truffles sauce that were nowhere to be found. The wine menu is off the charts making it a possible alternative to an AA meeting. So from now on we will look at the pig from its perch waiting for a safe landing to our world of commoners. Please buddy don't take long.,0

The restaurant has a great charming British pub or cottage feel and even with the large number of tables, expect a long wait. They don't take reservations so get in right at the opening and get your name in. The beer and wine lists are great and have many interesting inclusions. The spotted pig biter was great with the legions of meat. The food was all incredible. Unlike other great restaurants, the entire menu was stand out, not just a single item. The chicken liver spread was amazing with a sweet note that went so well with wine. The devils on horseback, Bacon wrapped dates were also a great balance of sweat and salty. The gnudi were chewy and cheesy. The mussels with Thai Green Curry and cocunut milk were so good with a great tangy flavor. The pork cheek and liver dumplings were so good, no wonder they have pig paraphernalia everywhere. The cheeks were so crunchy and chewy but flavor packed. The dumplings were tender and succulent. The burger is also truly superb. The meat is so flavorful and tender and seasoned so well. The fries were also great with rosemary making them seem fairly light. The creme caramel was great too, very light and airy bit sweet and creamy. When the only complaint about the place is the exceptionally hot bathroom, it was a pretty excellent experience.",1

The bartender was attentive and friendly - they have some interesting beers on tap and he let us sample before we made our final selection. Now for the meal: we had the burger with shoestring fries and the scrambled eggs with bacon and a biscuit. The burger was delicious but more rare than I expected but I thoroughly enjoyed. I snagged a strip of bacon from the egg, bacon and biscuit dish to complete the dish. The fries were amaaaazing! They were made w/ garlic slivers and rosemary which was a very unique taste! The scrambled eggs were good. Again these were cooked as little less firm than I'm used to but still enjoyable. But let's talk about this homemade biscuit: it was warm, fluffy, crumbly and tasty all at the same damn time! LOVED it. Overall this place is solid. I would come back here again for these dishes and to explore more. Will update once I do!",1

Small place, with a long wait on a recent weeknight (and no reservations) it is still extremely worth it.  My college buddy and I sat at the bar and had a few of the less than stellar draft beer options - the bottle list is definitely better and worth a look.   But once we were called to our table, it was on.  We went upstairs into a tiny, cozy room and sat at a tiny table in a somewhat romantic, dimly lit room.  Good service, quick to order and to turn over tables, they were helpful in making sure we were happy then getting us on our way. We both ordered the burger because we love burgers.  I wasn't sure I'd like the Roquefort cheese, but I trusted and I am glad I did.  Perfectly cooked to a medium rare, it was soft, melt in my mouth good.  No ketchup, just an amazing burger that makes me want to go back right now and have another again.  The shoestring fries are great too, just crunchy and great texture play compared to the burger. This place is extremely popular, for good reason.  Come on off hours or expect to wait a looooong time.  But still, come and enjoy, and get the burger.",1

125664,1814,3.0,1,2014-08-15,"TL;DR- great atmosphere, so-so food, off-putting service, long wait. I went here for a Friday lunch with one other person, we were the first people seated and ordered in under ten minutes. It took over an hour to get our food,  same for the couple next to us. We saw multiple tables that arrived later get served first, despite having ordered the same dishes.  The waitress was knowledgeable but condescending and inattentive.  When I asked for the check because I couldn't wait much longer she was noticeably affronted and became aggressive. She assured me my food would be out soon so we stayed. The manager (?) delivered it and was equally abrupt. The gentleman next to us tried to tell her about the wait but she interrupted him repeatedly with a rote line about different foods taking longer to prepare (they were probably the 2nd or 3rd order placed in the whole restaurant and we saw their exact dishes go out to several other tables before they got theirs so this made no sense.) The food was good not amazing. The chicken liver toast was a great, savory start but the octopus special, gnudi and frites were completely forgettable. The spotted pig bitter ale was beyond bland and watery but the cocktails were fine. The restaurant itself is casual and cozy. The decor is charming and sets a great Boho chic tone. The bus service was commendable and the bartender actually left the bar to bus and close out checks. The waitress and manager gave off the ""we're successful and have good reviews so we don't have to bother being courteous to individual customers""  vibe which killed the whole place for us. This was the first time in over five years I've tipped less than 20-30% (purely for service/attitude, not affected by the long wait.)

13930,1814,4.0,1,2014-08-13,"Even at 3:30 PM on a Sunday afternoon, the Spotted Pig is mobbed. I suppose it's a testament to the quality of the food here. Just try to fight your way to the waiting list and then assertively make your way to the bar while you wait for a table. You may actually walk by the venue because the exterior is cluttered with several potted plants and a couple of benches (similar to the Breslin) and you might mistake it for a nursery. The interior is homey, with several framed pictures, decorative plates and curtains you'd find in a country B&B. You should also take note that from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the Pig only serves its bar menu. Thankfully the burger was available and that was the primary reason for my visit. The burger arrives with a heaping mound of shoe string fries tossed with rosemary. The fries look like they're about to swallow the burger like The Blob. The bun had an attractive sear pattern and the amount of roquefort was just right. The burger itself is a hefty patty of delicious beef. It was prepared perfectly and tasted great. Resist the urge to cut the burger in half because this is a burger that should be eaten with both hands. We had some apps as well. The deviled eggs were okay but the chicken liver toast is very good. It's not dry and crumbly and they spread it onto thick slices of crusty bread. It is not a dainty amount either. This is a nice way to introduce people to chicken liver. Add this burger to a must try in NYC list.",1

A family of 4 sitting near us seemed very aggravated at the amount of time it took to get their food as 't alone in thinking the service was slow.

Walked in around 6:40, got seated at 7:15, not a terrible wait. Went with a buddy last night and ordered: Ricotta Gnuddi - Really damn good, light balls of ricotta with a pesto/butter sauce Chicken Liver Toast - Also very good, rich and iron-y, dipped in left over ricotta sauce Burger - Texture was perfect, Charred bun with great medium rare burger that was buttery and savory. Roquefort cheese was a nice touch, and the PILE of rosemary fries were delicious. One of the top burgers in NYC for sure. They took the pig ear salad off the menu which is disappointing, but I would definitely explore some of the other bar snacks. Will be back for sure.",1

Nice portion of greens sautéed in garlic.  Could use lesser oil. Adorable decor ... including the cute pig stubs,  vegetable posters and other curios.

Our party of four was seated at a six top booth with two inches space between the tables and bar stools added to make it seat eight. When the next four top was seated we joked with them about our proximity. Started with Devils on Horseback and bruetta.  Both were good. Was a little surprised at the tiny cheese serving for the price, but impressed with the flavor with the beans. By the time our entrees arrived we were all sweating in our crowded booth.  We realized we were luckier than the poor table with their back close to the bar getting hit by everyone walking by and closer to the loud annoying guys sitting at the bar. The two guys in our party separately went to the unisex bathroom and were hard-pressed to decide if it was better than a Texas porta potty in August.  They said it was cleaner, but melt-your-face hot and amazingly small. Entrees were fine. Service was fine.  We had planned on dessert, but were ready to leave the uncomfortable hot table and sprinted to the door when the check was paid.

The trick is to come on a weekday mid afternoon from 2-4pm if you dont want a line. If you come on a weekend, prepare your stomach for a three hour wait with snacks. I get the chicken liver toast everytime I'm here. And its absolutely amazing. And probably very unique to this place. I've never ate this at any other restaurant. It's a thick toast with a chicken liver spread that is super flavorful. I have no idea what they mix it with, but it's addicting. It's so yummy, it deserves its own paragraph I've also tried their burger to which it claims to be the #1 place in NYC. Probably not the bestttt ever, but pretty damn good. It's perfectly grilled where the meat is juicy and flavorful. I love any type of cheese, so the blue cheese crumble is a nice touch. But if you are like my cousin who despises blue cheese. Opt out of it. Burger also comes with famous shoe string fries. Fine thin slices of traditional fries basically. Tasted the same like regular fries to be honest.

Bartender was busy and a little curt with me. We shared the chicken liver toast which wasn't too bad, but not great. It's pretty heavy. My friend got the Gnudi Balls and I got the burger with shoestring fries. I'm not going to lie, I've had much better burgers. The gnudi balls were so-so.

That happened at 7:00 pm -- we gave them our phone number and went around the corner to the Rusty Knot (fun tiki bar with an excellent frozen mojito, by the way) to wait. At 7:45, the host called us and told us a table would be ready by the time we returned. But it wasn't. The host said our table was ready, but he had to put in some orders before seating us. We cheerfully waited outside, expecting to be called inside any minute. After another half hour, we politely asked again about out table and were told, again, that our table was ready, but they had to put a few more orders in before seating us. No attempt to be more creative/plausible with their excuses, no apologies.

125681,1814,5.0,1,2014-07-28,"Given that April Bloomfield just won the James Beard award, I think anything less than 5 stars would be inexcusable. This is less of a review of one particular experience and more of an homage to all of the experiences I've had put together. This is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in New York City. For several reasons. I've worked in 5 Star Hospitality for a long time, and one of my favorite parts about the Spotted Pig is their uncompromising commitment to quality, both of food and of experience. Part of this commitment is their refusal to acquiesce to the whims of guests. If you don't want to wait for an hour, that's fine. If you want to ask for 15 amendments to a dish because you want it a certain way, have something else. These aren't short order cooks on the line, they're culinary masters, and trust me when I say they know a hell of a lot more about what will make your tastebuds sing like a choir of angels than you do. That said, you should know what you're getting yourself into. It's a small restaurant. As such, the tables are small too. If you want space to stretch out, you'll likely be disappointed. With that in mind, every dining experience I've had has been incredibly intimate, and I've never felt like I was on top of someone else (except maybe when I was trying to get in or out of my seat). They also don't take reservations, so get there early, or be prepared to wait. Trust me when I say it's worth it. The burger is wonderful, but there are so many other incredible things on their menu it's hard to believe that's the most reviewed item here. Their burrata with wild mushrooms is to die for. The mignonette they serve with their oysters is sinfully good. Their steak with roasted beets tastes like Jesus cooked it for you himself, and as an added bonus it's very healthy. Their seasonal specials are incredible and constantly changing. The pork rillete is the stuff of my dreams. The corn soup is quite literally to die for, and it's a damn good thing I don't live in Greenwich village or it's all I would eat in the fall.  Throw the shoe string fries (with fried garlic chips and rosemary) into the soup and it's entirely possible that your taste buds will say ""We quit, because nothing you could ever give us will taste this good."" They have an excellently curated wine list, and every single one of their servers, bartenders, hosts, and servers assistants knows everything about every inch of both of their menus. I've never had a bad experience, and I don't know that I ever will.",1

Well that's the case where The Spotted Swine is concerned. We called ahead because one of our party is gluten sensitive and asked if the PIG could accomodate this ! So off we went and WOW, did we get service! One of our party order the Swine's famous burger, medium ,no,no,can't do that cause the""Chef"" will only prepare it the way SHE believes it should be prepared. The gluten sensitive member of our party attempting to be as accomodating as possible to the PIG and ordered their burger and asked that it be served without the bun since it was NOT GLUTEN FREE(ah, remember we were told they could accomodate gluten free) and instead to please provide the buger with lettuce leaves instead. The burger was dropped in front of us no bun and NO LETTUCE. When we asked about the lettuce we were told that they are ""not allowed to provide lettuce unless we ordered a full salad as the ""Chef"" would have it no other way. Not only did our waiter support this rediculous rule but so did the Swine's trainer or should I say manager. We had also explained that one of our party counld not have dairy and asked that the meals be prepared without , ah CHEF. Now I understand that it can be very challenging for someone with food sensitivities to find places out to eat. But, one would hope that if you called ahead to verify a restaurants ability and willingness to meet your needs that they would answer you honestly rather then in a manner only to pull in another dollar.

Why did we trek all the way out here and wait for an hour for a table?  Why, for the burger of course.  HOWEVER, the burger was probably the most disappointing part of the dinner (but i'll get to that). We mad our way (finally) upstairs to a little alcove crammed with 5 tiny cocktail tables - I know they were going for the cozy theme, but these cocktail tables in a side-nook-annex of the building just isn't doing it for you, Pig!  However, we were hungry for this long-awaited meal so we ignored the odd vibe (and right next  to the the bathroom to boot) and jumped into the menu. Mostly everything is pretty seasonal, and the menu ingredients switch out subtly for the seasons (so i'm told).  This time, ramps were in season, so we had an appetizer of sauteed ramps with a fried duck egg and crispy grilled garlic bread (a special that day).  Though a simple dish, this was the best showing of ramps i've had in recent memory, as the ingredients were left to shine. We also ordered a second special starter that day - carrots with cumin, oranges, and avocado.  The dish was light, yet creamy, and had a generous portion of avocado. Finally, we took a starter from the anchor menu, and enjoyed toast with burrata and wild mushroom. They don't skimp on the wild mushrooms on this dish, and they don't sneak in any of those boring, basic, cheap button mushrooms as filler, either.  This is a generous portion of earthy, woodsy mushrooms on top of creamy burrata and chewy bread.  No wonder it's a menu mainstay. Finally, we shared a burger (THE MAIN EVENT!) but after those three incredible appetizers, the ""famous"" burger fell very very flat.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but the cheese was a bit overpowering, and the shoestring fries reminded me more of potato sticks (the ones you had growing ) tossed with burnt rosemary.  Still a tasty entree, but very underwhelming compared to the other things that Spotted Pig can push out. Ordering tip: get ALL the specials. Every one we had was exceptional.  Also, try a few starters and split a burger if you're coming here to ""try the burger"" like most people do.  You don't need a whole burger to yourself, as the other dishes on this menu cannot be missed.",1

It was just out of control! Even if you are grossed out by the thought, be adventurous and try it, you will be rewarded with such amazing taste.

The ambience was fun and kitschy: pigs lining the top windows, pigs hanging from the ceilings, pig made out of twine outside the restaurant. Our friend loved the pig theme. For starters, we ordered the deviled egg (flavorful, fresh, serves 2), devils on horseback (dates, bacon and hint of spiciness), and chicken liver toast (amazingly moist due to liver mixed with olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt: delicious but not very photogenic). For entrees: sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto (the buttery basil pesto was amazing!), their famous burger with Roquefort Cheese and shoestring fries. I must stop and say the burger is perfect if you split it with 3 other people. Its a great taste with the strong pungent cheese, medium rare juicy beef, very nice. If I were to eat the whole burger, I would not have the same review. And those fries! We could not get enough of them! They had slivers of garlic crisps and rosemary mixed with the fries. My new favorite fries! So aromatic! We just smelled fried rosemary and rosemary all night long. Loved it! (Also we were seated next to a rosemary plant). Last entree: Pig cheek sausage with fried pig ears. Loved the crispy salty fatty cartilage of the pig ears. The pigs cheek was perfectly done, falling apart into the rich savory salty sauce. Then, us pigs, ordered the rhubarb pie and lemon lime pie tarts. Loved the lemon lime tart, sweet and sour it was a perfect ending to a rich meal.",1

Server came by and we said we don't know what's good here. He goes ok I will come back n starts walking. My bf goes but we need ur rec Server stops n looks at us like wtf u want I say what do you recommend ""Everything here is good"" w the look asking for a punch to his face Then we order 3 things. 10 mins later I saw the specials on the wall. Then my bf called the server back asking abt the specials. He started telling us the specials which sounded so much better than the regular menu. These middle age ladies at table next to us were listening intensely. We ordered smt from the 7 specials. Then middle age ladies started talking to us like wtf he nvr told us abt the specials. Like ok if this is some kinda trick to see if I would score a special dish on a game show then great. But if not then mention the special without the ""punch me plz"" attitude. I got pork rilette and I put the spread on my bread n ate it. Server came around 5 mins later to tell me I should mix up my spread coz the top is all duck fat. Ok thanks dude I just ate half pure duck fat in one bite thinking it was gravy.. I asked for ketchup for my bf's burger. I said excuse me. This other server gave me the finger like ""wait up gurl"" like what the most dramatic frd pmsing w bad attitude that u have would do when his fuck bud dumped him. Dude need to turn up the service yo. Food is great but wtf w the servers? They need to be trained.",0

The atmosphere is tight, but two floors makes them capable of cycling through small parties fairly quickly.  The price is fair for how good the food is.  I will definitely be back, especially if they add the Bath Chap as a permanent part of their menu",1

Gnuddi is OUT OF THIS WORLD, ABSOLUTELY NUTS. Also chicken liver toast is nutso good The burger is 21 dollars (when i first went it was 18, just keeps going up) but to be honest it is one of the best burgers anywhere. Furthermore they are open til 2am. yup thats right 2 am. With the dearth of restaurants in nyc of this caliber open this late, this is a welcome surprise. alcohol prices are pretty fair. Although food is a bit on the expensive side, but who cares, all the food is of top quality and ambience is also great, and while the food is a tad expensive for gastropub, it is anything but a ripoff. worth every penny.

We started with a carrot and avocado salad that was so good, I am going to try to make it at home (the highest compliment I can offer). My wife was so overwhelmed with her monkfish entrée, she began speaking in tongues. At least I think that's what was happening, as I have never heard her use ""fish"" and ""fantastic"" in the same sentence before.  The rest was just mumbling. I had been told that their burger was something special. I tried it.  It is.

The food here is fun casual but no-nonsense modern British influenced gastropub food. Lots of playful takes on British classics, on the border between traditional and updated. The burger - i was very surprised, this seems to be extremely popular, but it is a very simple burger but absolutely wonderful in some way. She does it more on the rare side, the flavor is fantastic whatever they put on it, its pretty much just meat and bun but done right. Something special about this burger. Same goes for the fries. The chicken liver toast was really good too! I had some local craft beer. I had roll-mops which is some British dish seems like of Jewish origins, its pickled herring - delicious! I love pickled herring and this was done right. I had a Bannofee - this seems to be a very British nostalgic dessert with cream, bananas, and toffee, seems to have took hold in places like Australia and South Africa, good dessert, that toffee is unmistakably Anglo. If I lived in NYC I would come here often, the rest of the menu looks very good, its just great simple food but still something a little different.",1

We grabbed some stellar Bloody Mary's at the bar and went out side on the bench and people watched. The location is eclectic, cramped and full of character. They were slammed. We finally were seated upstairs after an hour or so. Server was busy so service was a bit slow. We had drinks in hand and each ordered a different salad. The roasted carrot salad with avocado and orange was probably one of the best salads of my life. The roasted carrots were just perfect. Huge chunks of avocado and juicy oranges with the perfect amount of the vinaigrette, which was to die for. Fresh herbs made this simple salad a masterpiece. My friend's bibb lettuce salad was just ok. Mine was the star of the show. Just wow. Order it. We split the deviled eggs which were good, but had a weird celery-tasting liquid on it. Wasn't crazy about these. We split their famous burger and yes, it was completely worth $21. It was a huge burger with the perfect ratio of meat to bun. Roquefort on top of the juicy meat was just to die for. Seriously another amazing dish. Shoestring fries with fresh rosemary. OMG those fries. We were too full for dessert, but this is a must-try if in the city.",1

After a few drinks at a different pub, decided an extravagant burger is exactly the late-night food I needed. Roquefort Burger ($21), Deviled Egg ($4), Nightingale Cocktail ($13). Delicious deviled egg, cold and creamy with a nice touch of condiments on top that balanced out the yolk flavor. Cocktail was small for the price, but tasted good, although not as strong as I would have hoped. As for the burger, they actually cooked the patty correctly (not as common as you'd think), but I felt the cheese overpowered the rest of the burger. I like strong cheese, but it wasn't balanced well at all, especially since most of it was towards the middle, meaning every bite got stronger. Shoe string fries felt more like a decoration than an actual part of the meal, but decent. Nice service, quaint place, but not paying for that again.",0

125696,1814,4.0,1,2014-06-30,"Wow, this place is a tiny, crammed, wacky  Plastic pig lights strung across the wall, cheap old posters of veggies, the world's tiniest bar and the world's most overworked bartender, itty bitty tables so close to your neighbor that you could eat off your plate, and about an hour's wait even on a weekday evening.  And yet I still loved it.  The ambiance was effortlessly hip (as opposed to trying-too-hard hip), and the food was delicious. Chicken liver toast as an appetizer was yummy and a hearty portion (two slices per serving).  The nightingale cocktail was divine.  Five stars for the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi -- which are basically little round, plump raviolis -- and the divine butter sauce they serve those sitting in, omg.  An excellent dish to share if everyone at the table wants just a bite or two, which is more than enough given how rich they are (portion size is seven per plate). The burger was good (NOT the best everrrr, but really good -- juicy meat, buttery bun, oozing melted blue cheese).  I wonder what it would have tasted like without the blue (Roquefort) 's an unusual cheese to put on a burger, and I wonder if some of the hype is just simply due to the novelty of that taste on a burger.  However, the meat patty itself definitely was very juicy and the bun was perfect, so I'll give the burger as a whole the benefit of the doubt.  The super skinny rosemary fries really made that burger dish sing.  I'd suggest ordering a side of the fries no matter what you get (as the table of four girls next to us did). Service was great -- unpretentious but polite, and appropriately attentive.  The hostess was particularly jolly, which kept me entertained while sitting at the bar waiting for a table.  (The bartender was not so jolly, but she was so darn overworked that I'll let it slide.) Not a five-star experience, mostly because it's a little overpriced for what you get, but a solid four stars.  Try to go on off-hours (if there are any), or come prepared to wait a while.",1

No 't give us any elbow room.  We managed to find seats ordered a few cocktails and ended up eating at the bar.  I went with the burger(which appears to be their most popular dish, everyone around us seemed to be having one) and my wife went with the Monkfish. The burger was definitely not the best burger that I've ever had, but it was indeed a great burger.  Dense patty, nicely seasoned and cooked up to a perfect medium temperature as I requested.  The bun was larger than the burger itself and did not have any dressing on it aside from their cheese.  The mustard that they serve on the side will clear out your sinuses in  seconds!  The french fries were really thin and absolutely delicious. I found my wife picking at them wit every bite of her monkfish. As for the , the dish was well put together.  Would I come back?? Ehh maybe but only if I don't have to wait.  They do NOT take reservations and they do not have any dress code from what I saw.",1

This decor of this place is pretty cool, it's not large, I don't know how some people say it's deceptively large, how do you think it's big??  The tables are literally on top of each other (side to side).  If you're back is moderately bad, I recommend not sitting on the stools.  They're not bad for your butt, but not for your back.  We ordered the chicken liver toast and deviled eggs for appetizer.  Now, i'm NOT a fan of chicken liver, but my uncle always has been, and I have to say, wow, wow, wow, absolutely delicious.  I love deviled eggs, and these were good, but i'd have ordered a second set of the toast before ordering the deviled eggs again. For meal, we both ordered the burger, medium-rare.  How's the burger come out, perfectly medium-rare.  The roquefort cheese literally matches this burger perfectly.  The bun is good and toasted well, and the meat is seasoned well as well.  The amount of fries you get is ridiculous too, and I like shoestring fries.  You will laugh at the absurd amount of ketchup you get if you ask though. Overall, this place is worth all the hype.  If you don't order drinks, as we didn't since we were drinking all over beforehand, it was like $35 a person after tax and tip.  Not bad at all for the area.  Go here, now.",1

I've had better for a cheaper price at Flat Top, Corner Bistro, etc. But I must say I really enjoyed the Shoestring Fries that were served on the side. In sum, I don't think this place is worth waiting for 2-3 hours. There are so many cheaper, superior food options in the neighborhood that doesn't require such a crazy wait. But if you must try, I suggest you come early for dinner on a weekday. I got here with a friend at around 6 on a weekday and there was no wait at all.",0

From the outside, I thought it was just going to have 10 tables or so, but there's two stories and they basically have that entire building. The wait was ridiculous on a Saturday for dinner, I think we spent 3+ hours there from start to finish. For our table, we ordered the burger, chicken liver toast, and gnudi, along with a separate order of their fries. My favorite of night was hands-down the chicken liver toast. Luckily the table next to use ordered it and highly recommended it; so damn delicious! Between the three of us, we probably had 4 lbs of potato with the two order of fries but their fries were super addicting. The burger was great. Cooked perfectly, well-seasoned and flavored, and the roquefort cheese took it to the next level. Try the gnudi since this dish isn't offered at alot of restaurants. I'm so happy that we got to eat it here! Food and drink quality is definitely a 5-star. Unfortunately, the food took unbearably long to get to our table. Like molasses ",1

However, people rave about their burgers but I found them to be so basic. There was absolutely nothing special about the taste or preparation of the burger and the fries were just fine. It tasted like any burger you could get at a diner, random hole in the whole restaurant, etc. In my opinion, not worth the price and not worth the typical hour wait for brunch.",0

Said it was amazing. 5. The runners and hosts all were very nice. Lowlights: 1. Very long wait and no reservations can be made. Waited 90 minutes for a table on a bench outside. 2. Tight fit. They have to pull the tables in an out for you to get in. 3. Our server was not very friendly. She did not ask how thing were or check in with us at all. Really was a great meal.

When you consider the food you are ordering is things like burgers, fries, etc. you expect good, but not great. I wouldn't say 5 stars if not for the chicken liver toast I would have said 4. Until The Spotted Pig I had never eaten chicken liver and was so glad I did. My good friend from Boston and I went here on a Friday night just hoping to get a table. We waited about 2 hours (or so it felt) and, while the bar was crowded, we made the most of it. We enjoyed a good glass of wine and met some people from the neighborhood who frequent the restaurant. It was on their advice that we ordered the Chicken Liver Toast . Thanking them still in my mind. For entrees I had the burger. Yum especially if you like strong cheese you will love this! Cooked perfectly and accompanied by the most deliciously seasoned shoestring fries. My friend got seared fish and that was also quite good. The place is busy and bustling and had great energy and our server was attentive but not overbearing.   No Jay Z on hand w/Bey and Blue haha so that was the only let down. I would go back here any time and I don't think I've ever said that about an experience where I ordered a burger and fries.",1

We ordered the Deviled Eggs which I usually don't like but these were good. The Grilled Cheese Sandwich was unbelievable.  Just unreal how good it was with the onion marmalade and mustard on the side.  The Burger was very good.  We also ordered the Cuban Sandwich.  My wifey warned them of her Cuban nationality but it 't taste it.   This is a very small space.  Perfect to have a drink and a bite and move on.  It !!!  I can't wait to return.",1

I tried it anyways and realized I am happy that I had never had the roquefort cheese before that point. It over powers the burger. As you can see even with the cheese issue I gave them 5 ratings. Wow, that burger is delicious and the 70lbs of fries they mound next to it are just as tasty. I definitely have to go back and try their other dishes.",1

The wait for drinks was quite short, the wait for food not so much. Even though this was a quiet Tuesday afternoon. Our order consisted of two of the 'famous' burgers, a seared char and the special of the day, prosciutto in pastry dough. The amount of string fries, that come with the burgers, was overwhelming - the burgers also big. But all you can taste is that ? Go to Bareburger for a proper burger with blue cheese. The two other dishes were tiny, the special served with no sides, unless five arugula leaves count. The dough and dried ham taste good because they're so fat and salty, not because this place tries hard. For desert we had a flourless chocolate cake, a caramel pudding (don't remember the name, don't remember too much about that dish either). The chocolate cake was much to dense - and there was soooo much of it. Without sour raspberries or relish to help it along, it's almost a disgusting desert. This place is not a pub, nor is it a great place to dine - and it is most certainly not worth any mention by Michelin. So whoever stole the pig sign is on to you, Spotted Pig. They know you don't do a good job, so you don't deserve a pig.",0

I also had the roll mops which was good but how the hell do you mess up picked herring with creme freche!! For my last dish I had the famous burger but it was a disappointment. Like another reviewer, I thought the burger lacked a char grilled flavor and texture. The patty tasted like it was broiled and the cheese overpowered the whole damn thing!

They don't seat you until your whole party has arrived, so we grabbed drinks at the bar. Our cocktails were refreshing and tasty. We were then seated upstairs which was very spacious. I loved all the pig-related decor. Of course we had to get the famous burger. I thought the patty was cooked perfectly, but I'm just not a fan of blue cheese. Also, I prefer big fat belgian fries over skinny shoestring fries. Definitely wouldn't say this is the best burger in NY. For apps, we shared the devils on horseback and pig ear's salad.

She also took my coffee sugar cube. How rude. Well that's just the date I took here. She will never be lucky again for me to take her back here with those 's talk about the restaurant instead since that's what ppl come here to read. Not about my date experience. We were seated upstairs with no wait. We did have reservations that I made. I know I'm classy. We got coffee and I made sure we got tap water. I am not paying for bottled water in NYC. The tap is perfect. So of course the gentleman I am I let my date order first and she ordered my favorite burger. I was not having that. I stopped the order and said I'm having the burger and she would need to pick something else. She got the grilled cheese. How dare she take my sugar 't even ask..,1

125706,1814,5.0,1,2014-05-28,"Went here last night--I cannot express how wonderful this place is. The servers were SO attentive and so incredibly friendly, not at all pretentious. The atmosphere is quirky, rustic, and low-key, and the food is just phenomenal. Wine is affordable, and food is worth every penny. GET THE CHICKEN LIVER TOAST. Holy moly, this is the best f***king appetizer I have ever eaten. Perfectly salty, deliciously rich--omg dreaming of it now. I was there for over two hours not because I was waiting and dinner was dragging, but because I genuinely did not want to leave. GO. For my entree, I had the gnudi, which was absolutely superb. Don't be thwarted by its seemingly small portion size--this stuff is rich and creamy and will fill you instantly.  My boyfriend had the hamburger, which was perfectly cooked and the fries were so enjoyable (that truffle !!). This place deserves every good word spoken about it. Cannot wait to go back!!",1

It was definitely packed and obviously the experience is subjective. This review only pertains to the bar. We show up and there is 5 of us and we go straight to the bar upstairs. I love the relaxed and casual ambiance of this place and I can't wait to come for dinner but I don't think I will come back to the bar. First the bartender took 23 minutes (I timed it) to actually acknowledge us. Then when she finally came to us, she gave us the biggest look of disgust I have ever seen. I mean I wish I snapped a picture of it. We all looked at each other and said we will have one drink and we will leave because that set a bad vibe with us. I will give her the benefit of the doubt that she was having a bad evening. I definitely want to come back for dinner so I will update my review then. I hear nothing but great things about this place so it sucks we started off on a bad experience.",0

32466,1814,4.0,1,2014-05-23,"I was super intimidated by this place at first being that there were few things on the menu that I would consider eating.  They had a special of fried pig hearts.  Enough said. However, it exceeded my expectations.  The drinks were amazing.  I wish I could remember the name of the one I had, but I know it was like an old fashioned and had the word ""collar"" in the name.  Bitter and strong.  Perfect. I opted for the grilled cheese, which came with a side of caramelized onions and mustard.  Weird combination that was UNBELIEVABLE.  I also got a side of their ""fries""... which was HUGE.  They were crispy and thin and delicious. Overall, it was amazing.  The decor was funky and eclectic.  The food was delicious.  The only reason I took off one star was due to the fact that if you wanted to in any way be ""healthy"" (like, I don't mean give me an apple and some ) the only options they had were salads.  Delicious looking salads nonetheless, but no protein or anything that could constitute as a real meal.  I am not complaining about my grilled cheese, it was relish!  But if I go back I will just be prepared for indulgence.",1

Had pickle pot, devils on horseback and olives appetizer (devils were best) and the famous burger which was fine but didn't wow. There's too many offerings out there just as good for less money with better presentation- think Bobby Flays or Bare Burger. I would go back for the friend recommended grilled cheese and another fine Bronx Brewery Ale. Wanted more from the menu and the atmosphere.",0

They are closer to medium rare, which is better than the alternative (medium well). Overall, I wasn't as impressed with the burger- yes it was juicy, the bun was fresh with perfect grill marks, but the cheese (goat cheese?) really threw me off in terms of taste. Had I knew about this and ordered cheddar cheese (if even possible), my experience may have been different. For dessert I did try the flourless chocolate cake. The consistency was that of a fudge cake, simple, rich and perfectly portioned. Overall, I think having read the rave reviews I had greater expectations. Nonetheless, service was great/friendly, food was OK, and wait was about 10-15 mins on a Weekday.",1

Chargrilled burger: still in the list of top-3 best burgers in the city, hands down; huge delicious patty good enough to wake up Lazaro.

Everything was spot on, as usual.   Meat hook specials - - Chargrilled duck hearts.  Deep, rich flavor with a bit of char from the grill.  Really nice. - Pork chop and grits was absolutely awesome.  Pork was perfect, grits were awesome.   - Country pate & duck rilletes with pickles.  Perfect.

14421,1814,1.0,1,2014-05-16,"I'm not a fan here. First the good. Drinks are excellent using interesting and uncommon liquids and very fresh and creative mixes. The Negroni especially herby and tasty. Good selection of artisnal beers - local and not so much, some quite pricey but all uncommon. The food left me flat. Burger was ok but at 22 bucks and with greasy unhealthy shoe string fries (nicely accented tho by fresh rosemary in the oil) - think of potato chips with a glass of Mazzola - no veggies and a butter pat of cheese all I can say is NO. ""Appetizers"" may ok for a chipmunk - things which should be giveaways. ""Bowl"" of olives at 4 bucks. Ok what's 4 bucks but for 6 olives?  Ditto for ""pickle jar"".   Stingy portions but most perplexing why on earth have these exotic dishes with great ingredients in a dive bar setting (I hate sloppy places) served by polite polished guys AND not a thing PIG on the menu except for pork rillettes. This seems to me an upscale tourist trap altho I know lots of locals there.  Like Yogi Berra said - no body goes here - it's too crowded. I don't get it. For a far better burger - healthier, tastier and more satisfying go to Bare Burger. Just as dingy but way better value. .",0
125711,1814,5.0,1,2014-05-14,The burger and shoestring fries are amazing. Worth the visit just for those. Also had the liver mousse which was delectable. Best I've had in a long long time. The place is cozy and loved the decor. Great beers and the staff were awesome at answering questions. We were seated near the kitchen and got to peek into their world which was exciting. Great experience and can't wait to visit again!,1

39206,1814,4.0,1,2014-05-12,"I'll admit it: badges of honor impress me as much as anyone. Scoring a Michelin Star is no small accomplishment in this town and I've been wanting to try this little corner restaurant in the West Village for a while to try the legendary burger. I've walked by dozens of times while returning from long runs along the West Side Highway, but in those moments I am rarely in the mood for a blue cheese-coated burger on a fluffy bun with a pile of shoestring fries, so my rendezvous with the eclectically decorated, ever-happening Spotted Pig was put on hold for too long. Yesterday, I am happy to say that the wait ended and I was not disappointed. I went during the frantic Sunday brunch hour fully expecting throngs of derby shoe-wearing, Ray Ban-donning, cuffed Bonobos-rocking 20-30 somethings standing around waiting for a coveted table. Either it was an off day, or the Spotted Pig just isn't a brunch hotspot, but I was able to saddle up to the bar, no problem. The pig theme is in full effect here. The vibe is fun, the decor is kitschy, the bartender and hostess were friendly and the food came out fast. As for the burger. Pretty damn good. $21 good? Maybe. Maybe not. If you don't love strong Roquefort blue cheese, it's not a good call for you. But the toasted bun and rosemary shoestring fries made it pretty special. The burger patty itself was juicy and delicious. We also ordered the beet salad and pickled vegetables, which were both nice and light. There is definitely a big enough spectrum of choices on the menu to accommodate both the gluttons and the dieters in the group.",1
125714,1814,4.0,1,2014-05-10,"Firstly, the wait time is inaccurate. The host told my party to wait for 20 minutes but it ended up taking about 50 minutes. Recommended dishes are the chicken liver toast (the best liver dish I've ever had) and the deviled eggs which aren't your typical homemade ones. The Roquefort burger isn't for everyone's palate, but an above-par burger all in all. Definitely one of the better restaurants in NYC.",1
20370,1814,4.0,1,2014-05-07,The wait was about an hour. This is a small cute place with two stories and very dark lighting on the second floor. The tables are close together and cramped but very cozy. I ordered the burger here which turned out decent but nothing to rave about.,1
104365,1814,5.0,1,2014-05-06,Always awesome!,1
41333,1814,5.0,1,2014-05-04,One of my favorite neighborhood gems. Everything is good. Get there early for a walk in.  Great drinks.  Beet salad. Burratta.  And I have to agree the burgers and shoestring fries are delicious.,1
29518,1814,4.0,1,2014-05-03,"What can I say about my dinner at The Pig is that it is beyond what I expected. Thanks to my chef, we were hooked up as VIP and got many complimentary dishes from the restaurant. The place was packed but we got seated right away; and we happened to have saw Dave Franco dining as well. As for the meal, it was so satisfying. I was already prepared to order to couple of plates already and my dining companion was eager to see what The Pig had to offer. First course, we had the Devils on Horseback, Chicken Liver Toast, and a plate of oysters. By far, the Chicken Liver Toast was the best thing I've had that night; it had so much flavor to it that I regretted sharing it. Devils on Horseback kind of tasted like apple pie with smokey bacon so I did not mind that. Second course, we had the Duck Egg with ramps and the daily special of the day, braised pork cheeks on toast. The pork cheeks had a strong wine flavor to it which I would have wished they have cooked out but tasted fine. The Duck Egg was not anything out of the ordinary as well. Third course, he had the Ricotta Gnudi, I had the burger and we shared the Ramp Champ. We were practically full at this point but I still wanted to bite of everything. The burger was unsurprisingly, exactly as I expected where the cheese was so overpowering on the burger. I was lucky to take down just half of it. Gnudis on the other hand were pretty tasty and light. We ended the night with some dessert wine which was a nice end to a long meal. So what I can say if you're going to The Pig would be, get hooked up from your chef if just order three plates of Chicken Liver Toast.",1
34165,1814,5.0,1,2014-05-02,"It's hard not to love this place. A One Michelin Starred West Village gastropub that does what they do very well. A burger's preference is to each his/her own but this one is definitely my favorite burger in NYC. I rarely eat burgers (or red meat for that matter) and enjoy them as basic as can possibly be, no need for the full lettuce/tomato/onion/etc. I want to taste the juiciness and flavor of the burger itself. And this place does just this - you get thick piece of meat with some special cheese and the very perfect bun. Add the shoestring fries to it and you are in for a great meal. Add a beer and you are set. i don't think they do reservations here so expect a good wait for any seating if you come during peak hours. Definitely recommend for all you burger maniacs out there.",1
42359,1814,2.0,1,2014-05-02,"I've been spotted here before. And it seemed much better back in ye olden days. Last night we walked-up and the hostess was friendly. We were seated immediately at the bar and then offered an upstairs table. Used to a long wait here since they don't take reservations, that was surprising and super nice, although we discovered that the bar/first floor was much cooler than upstairs with a broken air conditioner. Stuffy air, close quarters, sweaty bodies; this is how people must've felt back in the Revolutionary War days when this building was probably built. Four of us ordered the burgers and shoestring fries. I thought the burger was ok although I ordered a medium and received medium rare. I like medium rare beef, but not on a burger due to Mom warnings (she's always right). The food runner probably mixed up the plate placements since the four of our orders were flip-flopped. Maybe they should have those little ""Medium Rare"" sticks on , maybe because of the roquefort cheese and over-seasoning of the meat. Each order came with a huge mound of shoestring fries, and although everyone else finished theirs, I could barely get half in my mouth. To me they were way too salty. You probably won't spot me here too much in the future, unless out-of-town friends put this on their Must-Do list. Although Spotted Pig's atmosphere is hip, there are so many other better burger places.",0
19079,1814,2.0,1,2014-05-02,"I've been wanting to try this place b/c I hear they have a killer , last night, a group of us descended upon the Spotted Pig to see what all the fuss is about. Sure, the burger was okay, but it was definitely not in my NYC top 20. The meat was tender and tasty enough as was the bun, but the Roquefort Cheese was a bit overpowering. Plus, I asked the waiter for lettuce and tomato b/c I generally enjoy them on my , ""We don't do that."" Well, they certainly have salad on their menu, so how big a deal would it have been to send out some leafy accoutrements?!?! A bit of a crazy policy, IMHO. As for the shoestring fries that are served with the burger, they are 're hard to dip into ketchup making them more of a mess than anything else. Again, IMHO, the fries are just all hype. [SPECIAL NOTE: The food runner mixed up the ""medium rare"" burgers with the ""medium"" burgers when he was passing them out to our table, so be sure to double check before you bit down!] The atmosphere at Spotted Pig is eclectic and interesting and is probably comfortable most , on the night we visited, it was hot and humid outside and the air conditioner in the restaurant was broken. NOW I understand why our wait went from 2.5 hours to ""oh, we can seat you immediately."" Beware of this place until they get that fixed, or you'll be sweating like a pig in the Spotted Pig! [The management should have warned us of the heat issue before seating us; I felt that was super discourteous.] So, would I return? H! do look appetizing, and I hear brunch is 'm not yet sure if those are powerful enough reasons to return.",0
11547,1814,5.0,1,2014-05-01,"Ohhhhh Spotted Pig. I've waited so long to eat you. I always have a good time here. I've been here three times. Each of which has been a culinary delight. Usually it can be somewhat difficult to get a seat. But this time, we were seated within 5 minutes. I can go on and on about the chicken liver toast but I'll let you decide for yourself. The deviled eggs were extra devil-y. Despite my best efforts of getting the hamburger yet again, I decided to partake in a palatable excursion by choosing the arctic char. It was good.",1
5504,1814,4.0,1,2014-05-01,"tl;dr: The food and cocktails are solid, but it's so crazy popular that you have to come at odd times to guarantee a seat. I have to admit that my expectations were probably too high for this place after reading all the Yelp reviews. I was expecting something legendary, which didn't quite happen, but the food was still quite above-average. Burger was indeed good: definitely top 10 in NYC, but maybe not top 5. Also not quite sure why there's so much buzz around the fries. For an entree, friend got the daily special of a rabbit quarter, which was done well but not quite as good as the burger. Chicken liver toast is a must-try, but you can probably pass on the deviled eggs. In terms of cocktails, try the Port Collar if you like Old Fashioned / strong brown drinks. Very limited seating; I wouldn't come here with more than 4-5 people.",1

However, much to my surprise, although the long ass wait was true, we were able to settle up to the bar upstairs and have an amazing time. The drinks were great, and Oh the Spotted pig.. How I dream of your delicious burger and hickory stick like fries. I think the best part about the place was the bartender upstairs. She was an absolute gem and treated these out of towners like locals.  And to top if off, the prices were completely reasonable. We absolutely loved the décor and would highly recommend sticking out the wait for this place. It was Beuno!",1

When I arrived at my destination-no fork, no knife, no napkins :( I'm mad that I tried to cram in burrata and a cuppa at noon in an hour?!  I told the woman that seated me and the young lady that brought water that I only had an hour. The people that arrived 15 minutes later were told that the waiter in my empty section was a bit busy (after being open for a few minutes) so they gave them a different waiter and they were served 10 minutes later. I had to then ask for a to go container. I love this restaurant. They just need to get it together when there's no crowd. They are firing on all cylinders when they're super packed.

The famed burger was pretty good but if you don't like SUPER strong gorgonzola cheese (more pungent than blue cheese) I suggest you try something else. Shoestring fries were awesome! Chicken liver on toast was divine. Bacon-wrapped figs were tasty. It's not like everything we ordered was !",1
81275,1814,2.0,1,2014-04-15,"Went there to see what all the hoopla was about. Tried the burger and the prunes wrapped in bacon. Honestly the burger has absolutely nothing special about it except the extremely pungent cheese(requefort). I can't critize this too much as it is more a matter personal preference.Take away the cheese and you are left with a so-so burger, nothing else. I found the fries very good and nicely crisped, seasoned with garlic salt. The prunes, although I found them creative, were very average if not flat/bland, in terms of taste. They do have a good beer selection, albeit limited. I give them props for a Well stocked wine selection. Also had the beet salad, which was very elaborate, but in terms of taste, again lacking. Now, event hough I was not impressed by the food, what bothered me the most was the bar preparation area. I saw some pretty terrible sanitary ""problems"" going on, which I will not elaborate here, but rest assured, it doesnt help my opinion of the restaurant. In general, I believe this spot is overblown. Sure the ambiance is nice and cozy, but with so many high quality restaurants in NYC, this place is hard to recommend. Did I mention its pricy too??",0

After waiting for 80 minutes, we were seated at, no joke, the worst table in the entire place.  It shouldn't be a table.  One person is sitting in a booth-like seat, and the other is sitting on a tiny backless stool, staring at the flourescent lights glaring from the kitchen.  Kinda ruins the experience a little bit!  There were 4 tables of 2 that opened up at the same time as us, so we asked to be seated at any of the others instead.  The person seating us said he needed to ask the hostess.  Big shocker, but she said no, and that the tables were reserved for other people.  Huh?  They don't take reservations, so those people were just walk-ins like us and had come after us!   We reluctantly sat where they put us, and watched as over 15 minutes, they seated the next few tables of 2 at the better tables.  No one famous, no one who looked like a special regular or anything.  So ridiculous and this poor chubby waitress attempting to get her revenge for a silly interaction at the beginning of the night.   The food itself was okay, the burger was fine, not amazing.  The one redeeming part was that we had a really nice waiter.  Based on this experience, I will not be returning.",0
28324,1814,3.0,1,2014-04-09,"I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news 's chargrilled burger is deeply, deeply overrated. Perhaps it's just a difference in taste buds, but I could not stand the taste of the strong cheese on that burger. I literally had to wipe the cheese off the burger patty just to consume it and even then, some residual cheese on the bun ruined the experience for me. It's very possible the majority of the reviews were written by people who love strong ';) Also, with no other toppings besides that horrendous cheese, $21 is ridiculous for one burger, ESPECIALLY if it lacks bacon! The shoestring , they're so thin, I could barely taste the flavor on them. Props for cooking the fries with real chunks of garlic, though. I did enjoy their deviled eggs and the chicken liver pate, however. I am sure their other appetizers are equally 's been raved about is actually not a big deal at all. The appetizers and the eclectic, eye-catching pork-centered decor were the saving graces  that gave this place a solid 3. That , this place revolves around all kinds of meat, right? Prime eye candy counts too. Still not worth a 2 hour wait though.",0

I've been wanting to go to the Spotted Pig for quite some time so we hopped in a cab & just went for it. Thank thy lord, the Spotted Pig satisfied my craving! I savored eating that burger as slowly as possible. The beef patty was thick - they sure didn't skimp out on the goods for this one. The meat was just cooked right - browned on the outside with a pink center & medium rare middle. The shoestring fries were alright. Personally, I'm not a big fan of shoestring fries - I prefer my fries a tad fatter because I like to taste the potato if anything. BUT the combination with the fried rosemary leaves and salt did make the fries very tasty. So a plus for that. If you can, get the deviled eggs as an appetizer. Worth it!!! Service wasn't crazy great but hey, it's a pub. What else do you expect? Looks like your typical British bar. Hard to do group meals here since it's pretty tight - might be best to just go with a few friends if anything.",1

We ordered the pickled vegetables and I had the burger- which I've read raves and raves about. And I gotta (and because $20+ burgers need to be compared) of Minetta Tavern's Black Label burger and Spotted Pig burger- Spotted Pig loses by a long shot. Minetta Tavern I would eat over and over and it was decadent and freaking unbelievably good- but Spotted Pig, I just wasn't impressed with any of the flavor and the toppings were sparse and kinda blah. My boyfriend ordered an apple salad that was like $15 and teeny tiny. He shared my blah burger and we left sad. After drinks and the overpriced pot of pickled vegetables- the meal ended up still being incredibly expensive. Our service was slow and they looked annoyed whenever we wanted to order something else.

29450,1814,4.0,1,2014-03-28,"I came for brunch on a chilly Saturday.  ~10 minute wait to eat at the bar, ~20 for a table. It's a large place--two floors, the lower floor with a bar and windows to let in plenty of sunlight, the higher floor more dark and woodsy and pub-sy (pub-ish? pub-y?).   Both floors were full during the few hours I spent here, and the space was warm and lively, not packed nor loud.  It's a nice spot to sit with friends.  We opted for a table upstairs but I think sitting at the bar would be fun here, especially if you're only a party of two. As for the food, I didn't love the offerings on the brunch menu overall, but what we got was solid: - The grilled cheese sandwich, made with three cheeses on the inside and, to my astonishment, a cheese on the outside.  Well done indeed.   - The dutch baby, which is a choice cut of a European child aged one to four, or maybe just a kind of a tasty pancake topped with bacon and dusted with sugar. Didn't try the renowned burger but I saw it all around, topped with hills of stringy fries.  Looked delish.  People seemed to enjoy putting in their mouths. Dessert is a no brainer: Banoffee pie. A British invention, it's a banana toffee pie and it must be ordered despite its ridiculous and ambiguous name.  (Ambiguous because, lacking any other context, it could be a banana coffee pie , why is that not a thing?  That sounds great.)   Things like this pie are one of the many reasons our stomachs are flexible.  Whatever you ate and drank beforehand, however you feel, however bad an idea it may be to order a dessert, just shut up and order it and then shove it in your mouth, safe in the knowledge that your stomach will almost certainly stretch to accommodate it.   Someday, perhaps someday soon, all hell's gonna break loose.  Political or environmental disaster will be upon us.  Cities will topple.  Land masses will flood.  Regimes will rise that will most certainly not be pie friendly.  And you--YOU!--will be left cold, scared, perhaps injured and perhaps alone, and you will stare out at the apocalypse around you and note the chemically and syrupy atmosphere, and your heart will sink with the recognition that on top of all the other things that are horrible, it is now also true that you are unlikely to ever again have the opportunity to eat this pie nor, indeed, any other pie.

125734,1814,2.0,1,2014-02-22,"We arrived around 5:20 PM and were seated almost immediately.  Dinner service starts at 5:30 PM for them.  The specials are written up on the board on the wall furthest from the entrance.  Service was attentive and helpful.  We ordered three dishes: Chicken Liver Toast: While its appearance doesn't actually look very appetizing, it's very flavorful.  The liver that pairs well with the sweetness in it, which I'm guessing is carmelized onions -- though I didn't actually identify any distinct pieces of onion because I ate it too fast.  The crispy toast balances the heaviness of the dish and gives a satisfying crunch with each bite. Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries: Word of warning, we asked for medium but this came out rare.  When we cut the burger in half, the meat in the center was a dark red, which is great if you're grinding your own beef or shopping in a grocery store, but not so much in a burger.  We sent it back and got the burger back a little more well cooked.  The burger meat was still juicy after the reheat, but by itself, the meat is minimally seasoned.  The Roquefort cheese reminds me of a salty blue cheese which at times was really over-powering.  The bun is grilled, but other than presentation, doesn't add anything in terms of flavor (no caramelization, just grill marks).  The shoestring fries however are something else.  These were awesome.  They were thin and very crispy.  I didn't get the feeling of greasiness that I get from some other fries I've tried.  They were perfectly seasoned with the right amount of saltiness with hints of thyme and garlic.  There were also small pieces of fried garlic chips mixed in with the fries as well.  All the flavors were well-represented without being overbearing. Spiced Pork Cheeks on Toast: Very tender and a good blend of spices.  Unfortunately, quality control seemed to be an issue tonight and the cheeks were sent on on burnt pieces of toast.  The cheeks themselves were tasty, moist, and well-cooked.  The toast would have complemented the meat pretty well, but the burnt taste pretty much poisoned the taste of the combo and so we ate the meat alone. Upon leaving at around 6:30 PM or so, a line had formed so I'd suggesting aiming for an earlier dinner to avoid the rush.  Overall, the experience was overpriced for poorly cooked food.  If I were to return, I'd probably get just a side of fries and the chicken liver toast.",0

Vibrant food, mulled wine; The Spotted Pig is buzzing each night and you are bound to run into someone here. With that in mind, prepare in endure long waits and cramped seating. Definitely a place for some mean eats. Don't be confused with the menu here, just know that this establishment belongs to that British subgenre called the ""gastro-pub,"" a bar serving simple, straightforward food. However, straightforward at The Spotted Pig means traditional English food transcending into an Italian twist.

But where else can you get Gingerbread Pancakes with a light vanilla cream, candied almonds, and a blizzard of powdered sugar? Or their Deep Fried Poached Eggs with Chorizo Stew? Did I mention their Fried Duck Egg with Ramps and Anchovy Dressing? Or their Two Poached Eggs with Roast Pork Hash? Damn, I'm hungry again!",1
17116,1814,3.0,1,2014-02-21,"Prior to my visit to Spotted Pig, I had gone through the countless reviews, articles, and accolades focused solely on its renowned burger; I had built it up in my mind to be, quite possibly, the best burger offered in all of Manhattan. But, let's cut to the chase. Expectations, especially those built up without substantial reason, are only doomed to fail. And similarly, Spotted Pig's burger is not life-changing, but it is a pretty solid burger. I'll give it that much. Set in a somewhat isolated and quiet street in Greenwich Village, the exterior of The Spotted Pig looks nothing like a gastropub or restaurant. After a little bit of searching for the door, I managed to put my name down on the waitlist and was given an estimated 45 minute wait. One downside is that they don't take reservations, so depending on when you decide to drop by for a meal, your wait time can be nonexistant to upwards of 1 or 2 hours. They usually recommend you grab a drink or two at the bar and provided that it isn't swarming with people (which it was on a Friday night), it may be your best option as there aren't many other places in the area for your to wile away the time. The two of us returned and were quickly shown to our table where we were seated against the wall. Tables are placed nearly side by side, and it was impossible to not overhear our neighbors' conversations; there was hardly any table space to even hold our drinks and menus either. At the very least, my friend and I had no need for the menus and were immediately ready to order; after all, we had come here just for one thing: the Chargrilled Burger. In hindsight, our plates looked far more impressive than they actually tasted. A towering pile of shoestring fries is plated next to the burger, a sizable portion of beef neatly sandwiched between two toasted brioche buns with a thin layer of melted roquefort. The shoestring fries were particularly annoying for me as it's impossible to eat more than two or three at a time and the lack of substance in each bite was particularly unsatisfying. Even more of a nuisance was the fact that the remainder of the fries were inseparable from the pile of rosemary they had been seasoned with. As for the burger - I had requested mine to be cooked to a medium and found that it had actually been cooked closer to well-done. Neither could I find anything particularly notable about the patty, except for the unique use of roquefort (as I have a particular weakness for goat cheese). Perhaps the most I can applaud this burger on was the brioche buns, which were the perfect width, smartly toasted, and with the perfect criss-cross grill pattern, although these too seemed to overwhelm the actual burger. So, while I can't personally recommend The Spotted Pig's burger (Bloomfield's burger at her other establishment, the Breslin, is close to life-changing, however), it's certainly worth a try.",0
15648,1814,5.0,1,2014-02-19,"Finally made it back to try the highly exaulted burger. I'm here to confirm that its damn good. Insider tip if you don't want to wait for hours to eat at the Spotted Pig- come during the week for lunch. I came on a Tuesday afternoon and walked right in. As always the staff was very pleasant and easy going. There is something very relaxing about The Spotted Pig during the day when its not a mob scene. It's in a great neighhborhood and you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy a delicious burger while the sunlight streams in through the windows. On this day I had a view into the kitchen, which is always cool. The burger was taking longer than expected, so they gave me some spicy almonds with honey to dip as a complimentary treat. Very nice of them. These were a very tasty little treat while I waited. The first thing you notice is the insane mound of fries that come with the burger. Check my pic for reference. I am usually not a skinny fries type of guy but these were addictively good. I feared they would have the texture of those potato sticks you get in the super market but not the case. They magically manage to keep they crispy, yet soft on the inside. And I loved the little fried slices of garlic dispersed throughout. One thing they know how to do is cook your burger. I ordered rare and it came perfectly rare. A nice two handed burger with a fat 10 ounce patty, which is the way it should be. Terrific soft, spongy roll which has some cool grill marks. The burger itself is terrific, but beware if you do not like blue cheese you will not like this burger as the roquefort is quite strong. I had my doubts that it may overpower the burger, and while certain bites when you got a moutful of cheese did the majority of the experience was delicious. Somehow the taste of the meat manages to work in unison with the strong cheese flavor. So simple, yet so good.",1

41381,1814,4.0,1,2014-02-16,"Notoriously long wait times as they don't take reservations of any kind, cramped seating, and not exactly cheap. Throw all that out the window, because once you try the melt in your mouth burger and delicious shoestring fries, you'll be transported to a land of milk and honey (that is actually meet and cheese). Your best bet is to show up early on in the evening or super late, put your name down and go for some cheap drinks in the neighborhood. Wait for your ""table's ready"" call and indulge. The burger is legendary and for good reason. Minor Critique: Thought the cheese was just a tad overwhelming, but maybe they put just a bit too much on mine. Also tried the skate (skippable, too salty, but tasty and filling for a white fish) and the roasted beets (awesome). Will go back soon for the other stuff, non-burger. Get a couple drinks--they make excellent cocktails--which are best if  they're putting you in the high single digits for the night and then proceed to eat some delicious pub-food, that seems to have like started the whole gastropub thing in this wonderful city we live in.

Beyond the food the place is great, so interesting and fun, and the music was some of the best I've heard while out.  The people who work there are super knowledgeable, friendly and beyond charming.  I can't wait to head back next time I'm in the city; the food, the people and their taste in music make it one of my favorite spots.",1

The draught beer menu was limited, only about 4-5 beers.  But they did have a good cocktail list.  As for food, it looks like the menu changes daily since there was the date on the top of the menu.  The dinner menu was very gastropuby and different. We ordered the devils on horseback (amazing as always) and the chicken liver toast.  The chicken liver toast was a little mineral-tasting, so if you don't like the taste of liver, I wouldn't order it, but I thought it was fantastic.  I had a winter green salad which was very good and my friend ordered the fried duck egg salad which was phenomenal.  My friend and I then decided to split the burger and shoestring fries.  We ordered the burger medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The waiter said that some people say its the ""best burger they've ever had.""  I'll agree it was a good burger, but probably not the best I have ever had.  The shoestring fries were good as well.  They were flavored with salt and fresh rosemary.   For dessert we got the banoffee pie.  I was skeptical because sometimes bananas can be funky in desserts but this was absolutely amazing.  We finished it and I wanted more! Now, about our waiter, he was kind of pretentious.  We have never been here before so we were asking questions about the menu and his tone of voice for his answers were along the lines of, ""well why don't you know this.""

A decent beer list (with unfortunateely just a handful of taps) with a very well assembled burger (thick patty with just the right amount of roquefort on toasted brioche) all within a warm and cozy pig ornament filled room did make for excellent late night dining. Only quibble is the cost. $6 garnered us a small petri dish of pickled vegetables (which is not what one imagines when ordering a ""pot of pickles""). And while that burger was certainly worth $21 in that particular time of need, this would not be the case on any given day. All in all, a tentatively strong thumbs up.

The chicken liver toast was probably one of the best things I've eaten recently.  It was rich, fatty, and fruity all at once.  The toasted bread it came on was perfectly suited, being at once crisp and pillowy soft.  Why can't other restaurants put out excellent appetizers like this for $6?  Along with a glass of their house Spotted Pig Bitter (brewed by Brooklyn Brewery specifically for them), this was a great start to the meal.  I enjoyed the burger as well to a lesser degree.  It came a perfect mid rare and was very flavorful, but unfortunately was overshadowed by a heavy hand with the roquefort cheese.  Don't get me wrong, I love a burger with blue cheese and this was an awesome, salty, funky blue cheese.  But it's so strong and there needed to be less of it to balance out with the beef.  Next time, I'm getting it on the side.  The homemade shoestring fries are more like homemade potato stix, and they're awesome.  Get the homemade mustard and ketchup for dipping, and you'll be happy so long as you aren't counting calories.   I'm not sure if this deserves the #3 ranking they got awhile back in the Daily Meal's top burgers nationwide list, but it was damn good--as was the rest of the food.  Next time I need a good burger, this will be high on my list.  Not to mention the rest of the ",1

It sided the table from start to end. We had something to nibble the whole dinner. They aren't so special, but I personally found it a great choice to make the dinner more enjoyable. Roll Mops. It was my first time tasting pickled fish so I can't compare it, but I really liked this snack. I was expecting it more salty and sour, but instead I would say that it was a little sweet. Chicken Liver Toast (I don't remenber the name of this one). Very tasty. Chargrilled Burger medium rare. At first I thought the the blue cheese flavor didn't combine very well with the rest of burger, but by the time that I was finishing my half of the burger I realised how much I was enjoying it. I am not personally a fan of roquefort, and this burger didn't became my favorite, but I definitely consider that it's worth to try it. Grilled Skirt Steak. I also liked this plate. The meat was soft and tasty. Now the cons. I am not really a fun of fries, so I don't really care, but I didn't like the Shoestring Fries at all. I liked The Roasted Carrots With Thyme instead. We asked for ketchup and they brought tomato sauce (maybe is their homemade ketchup). Personally, I love ketchup but I hate tomato sauce, but I didn't need it, the burger had already a lot of flavor! The tables are too close. I am not completely sure about the prize since I didn't pay, but I would say that it all could have cost 95-100 + TAX + TIP = $125 which I find a bit over prized for the quantity of food but not for the flavor/quality of it.

Tables are uncomfortably close together, with hostesses consistently cramming 4 into a table that should only have 3, ensuring that one or two people in a party are sitting in the lap of the people at the next table.  Asking for something with more space is met with scowls and exasperated sighs of ""why are you being difficult just sit where i put you and shut up."" The wait staff are more pleasant, even jovial.  The camaraderie of the wait, bus and bar staff carries over nicely to their interactions with the guests.  Speaking of the bar, well stocked with competent bar tenders.  Even though ours was a but stumped by a drink he was not familiar with, he recovered well and with aplomb. The menu is decent, though perhaps does not represent the food particularly well.  The burger was somewhat overdone, and a bit more greasy than juicy.  This was compounded by the Mt. St. Helens of shoe string fries piled on top, which released their oil into the bun between the kitchen and the table.  The frittata was decently cooked, though either the ricotta cheese was too overpowering or the egg and broccoli rabe were too under seasoned, but only one of them was flavourful. The hash is rather a disaster.  It is primarily roasted and sautéed potatoes with a smattering of herbs and a vague smear of corned beef.  The poached eggs were horribly overcooked, the white rubbery and the yolks mostly set, and were only tepid. One bright note is definitely the beets and greens side dish.  The roasted beets were sweet, succulent, and thankfully, not overcooked. In all, this seems more a tourist trap than anything, and certainly not worth the hassle of the disgruntled hostesses, cramped seating, and lacklustre cuisine.",0

The brunch menu looked most appealing to me, so we decided to squeeze in brunch here on Saturday afternoon. We spent our early afternoon in Chelsea and then walked down to The Spotted Pig from there. The website had stated that the busiest meal times were the 7-9 dinner time period, so I figured that if we arrived at 2:30 for brunch ending at 3 that we wouldn't have any problems. Well, of course, we arrive at 2:30 and were told that the wait was about 30-40 ? Instead, we found two bar stools and a shallow bar top attached to a column in the middle of the restaurant so that we could order brunch before the apparently-hard-stop brunch time of 3. We both got beers. My husband is a bit of a beer connoisseur but was unfamiliar with the Allagash White Belgian Style Wheat that I ordered. It was delicious! Their beer selection seemed quite impressive and right up our ally. Neither of us were extremely hungry so we decided to split the French Toast with Bananas and Bourbon Syrup. U! The whole dish was , the bourbon-flavored , but we quickly realized that this stuff needed to be slathered all over our dish because it was one of the best things we had ever eaten!

Overall: 4.5/5 (-0.5 for the long wait) Wait: We arrived during the end of happy hour, and I have to say, if you can, MAKE RESERVATIONS. This was the first time I was there and I was thoroughly impressed at how full it already was, especially on a weekday. It's definitely a bit of a wait. The server was so kind; since it was freezing outside and the downstairs area was a little awkward/crowded to wait, we were taken upstairs to the bar. Four girl, one male bartender. Lets just say, if you're good with words you can get a few free drinks. They've got a great selection of drinks that range from all sorts of flavors including fruity, sweet, sour, spice-y, ginger-y, herby, and more. That being said, I have to thank the bartender because he made our wait seem like nothing. [PS. I recommend the dark and stormy 's so delicious. SO DELICIOUS]. The decor: very unique; with the name spotted pig, you can definitely expect some pig portraits, which was amusing. The ambiance was very intimate. The lights were very dim and the booths were cushioned. The noise level was a bit on the louder side, but I could still hear what my friends were saying from the across the table. Everyone is in their own little bubble at their tables. Loved it! The food: I didn't know what I was eating half the time, but man it was so delicious! As a gastropub, The Spotted Pig has fusions and unique tasting entrees. If you want some appetizers, the fries are delicious. They're not your typical fat fries with a little bit of crunch. Instead, this fries are skinny and super crunchy! They're titled shoestring for a reason as to how thin they are. You cannot leave without trying the Chicken Liver Toast. Most people get a bit squeamish when there are not so typical animal parts on the menu, but trust me, this is delicious! I hope this isn't a disgusting description, but the liver has been grounded and seasoned and put on a large piece of toast. Since the bread crust is crunchy, the bite is both mushy, flavorful, and crunchy all at once. I know. Weird, but trust. TRY IT. If you don't like , at least you tried it before dissing it! That's fair. Lastly, my entree was the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart with Marjoram. Portions look small, but they're actually quite filling. But man it was so delicious. The crispy Ricotta tart was filled with marjoram (an herb) was the perfect about of crisp. The spinach and prosciutto gave both a fresh, yet salty taste that was not overpowering at all.  Fantastic.

It was very good with some kind of butter sour cream stopping that was pretty awesome. They have a pretty good beer selection with a few beers on tap and some bottled beers some of which even the beer enthusiast may never of heard of. I really like that they have a limited menu.

My friend and I just showed up on a Wednesday night, put our names on a list, and hoped. About 2 hours later, at close to 11 PM, we were seated, and when we had the best burgers ever.

125760,1814,2.0,1,2013-12-14,"NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!! As expected, it was busy on a late Saturday night. The three of us walked in around midnight. There was no one to greet us, Maitre de was standing next to us and completely ignored us. My husband was here before so he just took the lead and lead us upstairs. The ambience seemed really nice at first but what comes next was completely unnecessary and disgusting. A rather large garbage been filled with leftover food would be emptied inches away from tables and dragged down the stairs about every 15 minutes. No one carred to even close the garbage bag as it was dragged through the middle of the dining room. Does this place have a manager?? Inexcusable!!! Moving on and trying to forget the uncomfortable and the ambience was quite nice. Cozy and comfortable with nice decor and young business crowd. We are in early 30s and the crowd reminded us of what one might find in the meat packing district. Drinks were good but PRICEY. We got a table 45 minutes later but no big deal, we live in NY and are used to it. Food came about an hour later. The dishes had a nice appeal to it, that is until we tried it. All 3 of our dishes (2x burgers and 1x fish) were EXTREMELY SALTY. I could barely finish my burger. Shoe string fries were interesting at first but flavor was just ok, nothing to write home about. They were hard to eat with a fork and too small to pick up with fingers. Putting the saltiness aside and the burger and fish flavor was average. Sorry Pig but when I order your ""famous"" burger and with a premium price tag of $20 I expect to be impressed! Chefs, I don't care how many stars you have but if you don't try the food you're serving to your guests then you shouldn't be running a kitchen !! Restaurant is NOT CLEAN. Bathroom is dirty and there was no soap in the bathroom. (Yuk!) They forgot to bring my ordered drink so I had to drink water instead but it's not a big deal. The three of us must have drank a gallon of water after that dinner. We mentioned to our server the saltiness of our food but he seemed rather occupied with something more important as his only reply was ""oh? really?"". And then he wondered of. I gave it two stars because of nice decor and ambience. Food, service and cleanliness deserve a one star! There are just too many better and nicer restaurants in West Village. I would not recommend this place to anyone nor would I go back. There were other posts with similar issues so I'm hopping this review and others like it will either: a) provide some good feedback to the management so proper actions can be taken to fix the problem or b) educate decent folks to avoid this place and go somewhere better",0

125763,1814,3.0,1,2013-12-04,"I went back to the spotted pig the other night after a 3 year long hiatus. What I had remembered was a really really solid, classic burger, and laid back atmosphere. So when I called and asked about the wait for a 2-top on a sunday night, I was surprised and disappointed when the snooty host replied ""oh, it's really short tonight, you'll only have to wait an hour to an hour and a half"". Hmm, not the attitude I was expecting. I put my name on the list, and an hour later we were told to keep waiting, but without any real acknowledgment of how long, what the deal was, etc - just kind of brushed off. I'd be fine with the wait if the staff was a bit warmer. The burger was good, but not great, honestly. A pre-formed patty cooked medium, but still soft and mushy - not as in medium-cooked ground beef, but as in overly mixed, pre-pre-pre prepared patties. The only garnish of the burger was a bit of blue cheese, which was flavorful, but didn't really add a bunch to the burger. I felt the flavor was a bit masked by the blue cheese and bun, without a solid burger taste. The super fine fries were good on first taste, but overall a bit salty and over seasoned. I would have preferred half the amount of fries, with half the salt and seasoning, and hot. Love that they had the goose island on tap, and since we were seated at close to 10pm, by the time we were finished eating at around 11pm, the place had died down and was fairly chill. For the money, definitely not my favorite, but still an ok place in the village. Burgers I'd prefer over The Spotted Pig include: Corner Bistro and Commerce.",0
92260,1814,3.0,1,2013-12-03,"The fries weren't all I was expecting. They looked glorious! But were so thin, you could barely taste anything at all. Very sad. Overall the ambiance and venue was really cool. Didn't have their drinks so cant judge on that. They definitely get packed so get there early or prepare to wait 30-40 minutes since they don't take reservations.",0
27054,1814,5.0,1,2013-12-02,"Renowned for both its star chef and celebrity clientele, The Spotted Pig is well worth a visit by anyone who has a soft spot for gastropub cuisine. While the deviled eggs, fries, chicken liver, and scotch egg are all absolutely nutty, I really need to tip my hat to the Smoked Haddock Chowder. It is probably my favorite chowder in the city and displays a range of tastes and textures that I would be hard pressed to accurately describe. The homemade crackers that come with it are also very good. Add that the staff really is super accommodating and nice considering the amount of hungry people rolling through here, and you have one solid dining experience. If you can just get here any time between 2 and 4 pm you won't have much of a wait; but be warned they serve an abbreviated menu during these hours. At prime time the wait can get up to two hours or more. Anyway, I love this place, I really do.",1

It's a dance like nothing I've ever seen. The wait is long without a reservation, the drinks are pricey (12 bux for a vodka soda), but STRONG (yay! And be careful!), and claustrophobes should take a Xanax before entry. However, after waiting for over an hour, I actually began to love this nuthouse! When I tasted my roasted beet greens alongside my seared skirt steak, I knew I was having a once in a lifetime veggie experience! How do they do it? No clue, but I walked away with a sated palate and a cerebral experience I was not expecting to have!  What a trip.",1

The Mulled Wine was out of this world!!! The Bussers had a great attitude and were friendly! Decor strikes an interesting balance between super cute and hipster grandma kitch. Great Beer selection as well! This place is a very cool spot - the ambiance was very cool and crowded. CONS: Manager was extremely busy, hence the dismissive attitude is to be expected? Our waiter had a polite disdain for us.   The food was decent but not amazing -  as we had expected for the price of the menu. Apparently here the price does not equal quality.

Service was kinda whack. Our server was kinda flighty and we definitely spotted him taking shots with a table around the corner from us.  I'm all for servers enjoying themselves, but please don't pull a disappearing act on your customers.  I might come back, but probably wouldn't make a special trip.

125771,1814,5.0,1,2013-11-13,"If you find yourself walking around West Village- step off the main drag of Hudson Street and get to West 11th Street.  Look for what you might think is a florist shop.  There is no sign- just a spotted pig hanging over the door.  You've arrived.  Welcome to The Spotted Pig. Most days you will find a crowd of people waiting for a table.  It could be minutes.  It could be hours.  But they are waiting.  Waiting to get a taste of this eclectic establishment, partially owned by Jay-Z and Mario Batali.  If you get lucky, you may even see them here, or any of the other celebrities known to frequent here. David Schwimmer, Michael Stipe or Luke Wilson among others. It is worth the wait.  We, however, got lucky and were able to get a table right away (a late Tuesday afternoon.)  Our table felt more like we were dining in a garden.  Potted plants and flowers line the window sills that mirror the entrance.  A tiny bar and dining room downstairs and a bigger bar/dining area upstairs. We were having a girls lunch out and we couldn't have picked a better spot.  Order a pot of pickles, a plate of deviled eggs or the Chicken Liver Toast while you wait for the main course. My companion (my Mother) has come back for the Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Mustard and Onion Marmalade.  This is not your average grilled cheese- toasted on thick bread with gourmet cheese dripping down the sides (don't even know what kind of cheese they use but we didn't care- it was delicious.) The fries are a la carte.  But the portion is enormous so no need to have everyone at the table order their own.  Thin shoestring fries served with fresh rosemary.  Go ahead- dip them in the side of the onion marmalade or the spicy mustard that came on the side of the grilled cheese sandwich.  Your taste buds can thank me later.  You're welcome. I ordered the Burrata with Wild Mushrooms on Toast.  Burrata is a soft Italian cheese made from Mozzarella and cream that just oozed across my thick cut toast.  Topped with a variety of wild mushrooms including the Maitake or the ""dancing mushroom"", this was comfort food at its finest. We also ordered a side of the beets and greens.  Whole baby beets, roasted and mixed with bitter greens.  You will never turn up your nose at beets again and  I can now say I have experienced bitter greens that literally melted in my mouth. Forget I even mentioned Jay-Z.  British Chef April Bloomfield was recently on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon as well as the Today show. The Spotted Pig has been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The Los Angeles Times, Bon Appetit and now, lucky for them, here on The Hungry Sprout.  Or I guess lucky for me for being able to experience this. Did I mention they have even been awarded a Michelin star which is a top honor given to only the best of the best restaurants in the world?  Ya, they have one of those too. My only complaint is the lack of space for tables.  Some of the tables are very close together and you may find yourself sitting almost on top of the strangers sitting next to you. Then again, forget you read this.  I don't want to have to wait for a table in line behind ",1

Though we wrestled over the menu - we ended up ordering the beet salad to start (a special that day) and two burgers (hey, I earned it!) both medium rare. Beet salad was amazing, the best beet salad I'd ever had. Honestly, I said ""How does this taste SO GOOD?"" Then our burgers came, so juicy, so delicious. I'm also a sucker for a pretzel bun. Again, the best burger I've ever had. It comes dressed sparsely with blue cheese crumbled on top and is even better with a little bit of their dijon mustard. Simple, but so delicious - perfect really. The fries are really fun and terribly addictive. The rosemary and garlic that they're fried with are really fantastic. Excellent service, great environment, lovely neighbourhood.",1
7315,1814,3.0,1,2013-11-05,"For whatever reason I had in my head that this would be a big, touristy, bright place.  Instead what we found was a smallish, crowded, somewhat dark corner bar filled with what seemed to be localish folks out for Sunday brunch/lunch.  A nice surprise actually, but this is why so many here complain about the wait.  The place is small. Speaking of the wait it really wasn't bad to get seated, aligned with the 30 minutes we were told when we checked in, maybe even sooner.  But the  By the time it arrived it better have been damn good. It wasn't.  It also wasn't bad.  The chicken liver toast was actually very, very good.  Big portions, not a bad price.  Order these.  But the grilled cheese my girlfriend had and my sandwich which was on special (some sort of pig face meat thing) were boring.  No seasoning on the face meats, the only real flavor coming from the heavily dressed salad on top.  Very acidic. Service was just fine but the food didn't impress.  I get the feeling there are 15 other corner bars in the area that can compete on that front.  Explore accordingly.",0

So lets get the important stuff out of the way , a few points to the Roquefort cheese for creativity and points for the awesome fries, but some points deducted for too much butter. Honestly, the cheese, while differentiating the burger, really overpowered the entire burger. It was cooked nicely and evenly, perfect medium. The service was very good: timely and courteous. Beer and wine selections were awesome as well. Overall, the place gets 4 stars simply because of the burger. Its a good representation of the restaurant as a whole. I would still recommend it to people who want to try it or if they're in the area, but now that I've tried it I'd probably go elsewhere for my burger fix.",1
125775,1814,1.0,1,2013-10-28,"My husband and I went to the Spotted Pig on Sunday after a great walk on the High Line.  We had been there several years earlier and had a wonderful experience.  Not this time, by a long shot.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and deafening ""you are not cool enough for this place music.""  We were a party of 2 and so advised about a 45 min wait for a table.  We were good with that and waited at the bar with good drinks and some tasty shoestring fries.  By the time our table was ready - 45 mins later - we were told we were now only able to order the ""limited menu"" consisteing of 4 meager tapas style appetizer, a soup, a salad, some oyster thing, and a burger.  We said OK and were taken upstairs to our table is a cozy room set for small groups.   We were the first ones to be seated in that room, given water and menus.  Soon a few other parties showed up.  The wait staff immediately began taking their orders - and we were completely ignored by the wait staff.  We were 15 mins watching all of this go on in a room the size of a a few closets, so there was no missing us!   We asked for our check, and that was given to us without a moments hesitation (could not wait to be rid of us I guess).   On our way out the super friendly hostess offered us a super friendly ""See Ya Soon, Thanks!""  No - on both counts.",0
20322,1814,3.0,1,2013-10-26,"I was craving burgers, so I decided to check this place out. The website said that there is a bit of a wait for dinner, but never a wait during lunch. I went for lunch at around 1:30pm. The hostess said it'd be a 45 minute wait. That seemed longer than the no-wait advertised on the site, but I was ok with it. 45 minutes passed and no table.  I asked the hostess if she could estimate how much longer it'd be, and she said a couple minutes more or 20 minutes max at worst case scenario. One hour and no table. It wasn't until another 30 minutes passed that a table became available. Sat down and waited 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and take my order. So after 2 hours total of waiting (waiting for a table, waiting for the waiter, waiting for the food) I got my burger and was excited to devour it. The medium rare beef was overpowered by globs of bleu cheese. Every bite I took was a mouthful of bleu cheese. I really wanted to like this burger, but all I could taste was the toe jam cheese. I tried to erase the funk from my taste buds by eating the fries, but those were so over-salted that it just blistered my mouth. Overall, a disappointing experience. I really wanted to love this place. The second floor is very charming and a nice little spot. Unfortunately, the service and the food didn't live up to its hype for me. I'd be willing to give it another try if I didn't have to wait an hour and a half for a table during lunch. I was originally going to give this place 2 stars, but the waiter came through at the end and was pleasant, attentive, and quick to give me my check when I asked for it (the table next to me waited 20 minutes for theirs). Word of advice: whatever wait time they tell you, double it and that's how long you'll actually wait for a table.",0

16292,1814,4.0,1,2013-10-19,"Glancing at its name ""Spotted Pig"" and a bunch of photos of burgers on Yelp, some people might have a preconception that this place would have only greasy burgers/fries/heavy meat dishes, and so did I. However, you can actually enjoy seafood in great quality along with amazing appetizers with meat. **Waiting on line Checked this place for a weekday dinner with my best company at 7:30pm ish. It seems there is always a long waiting line, so put your name on the wait list and swing by a pub next to this place for a quick pre-game drink in the meantime. **Food Must-try appetizer at Spotted Pig is, not to mention, Chicken Liver Toast. I didn't expect too much, to be honest, but it was actually my favorite dish for that dinner. We also tried oysters and roll mops (with mackerel and cream cheese filing), both of which were really fresh and amazing. Especially the oysters, I believe, were one of the top qualities/freshness in the city. For entrees, we had pan roasted skate wings and sauteed black sea bass. Skate wings was also good as other yelpers applauded; mushrooms and potatoes on side were also great. The sea bass, however, was a bit disappointing as seasoning was not even so that some of its portion was overly salty. Not many options for dessert, but lemon tart would be a worth try. **Seating This place is pretty spacious. You can sit at the bar or tables on the 1st floor, but 2nd floor seating area is better; it's really cozy and you can sit side by side. You should ask 2nd floor seating if you are coming with your beloved one! Food 3.5 / service 4 / atmosphere 4. Would be love to stop by this place again to try other dishes.",1

Many times one has to wait much less then expected.  So, that part is worth forgiving for the unforgettable food you will experience. Burger is still one of the best in the country and in the city.  I don't even want to start describing all the flavors and textures. Simply the best of the best. Shoe string potatoes to die for. Gnudi is also something out of this world. I have cravings for that burger and shoe string potatoes every 2 weeks. When I do not have time to go there, I dream about it. Highly recommended if you don't mind waiting and the noisy but happy atmosphere. In its own category it is 5 stars.",1

27844,1814,3.0,1,2013-10-10,"I know my humble opinion will be lost in the sea of 1,400+ reviews on this place, but I was disappointed. So many famous manhattan restaurants are just sitting back on their laurels and not getting it done anymore. That's my experience anyway. I was equally disappointed at minetta tavern another absurdly hyped joint but at least minetta tavern didn't take nearly as long to get the food on a plate and in front of me. Here is my summation if you don't want to read me wax obnoxious for many moons: it's good not great and for the wait and price and pretense, I think tourists would miss out going here rather than other less hyped spots who deliver at a lower price (and won't make you wait). My girlfriend and I went. It was 6:30 on a week day so we had no wait which was surprising and cool. We got the pot of pickles which I always hope is actually pickles but as in other places was just random veggies soaked in vinegar. Boo. Their smoked haddock chowder was pretty stellar, I admit it. I hate smoked fish generally, worst jew in the land, black sheep of my people because i refuse to even acknowledge the presence of lox, but still, this soup was so well balanced and tasty with herbs and cream, it even passed my test. Well done, Spotted Pig. Unfortunately, the soup was the highlight. After the soup, we waited maybe 30-45 minutes for my burger and my girl's ""gnudi"" which is just a fancy word for a half-dozen mediocre possibly-fried round ravioli. It took FOREVER. Everything was extremely salty. When my burger arrived, it was medium I'd say (I'd ordered medium well) which was ok but meant to me they'd put it on the grill something like 10-20 minutes after we'd finished the soup. At best. We suddenly postulated that the reason this place appears to have such an insane wait is not because it's so incredibly popular and frequented by everyone in town, perhaps, but because their kitchen is really really really slow. Maybe even at the managers' behest to make it look like they're special and busier than they are. Onto the burger, first of all with famous burgers I order however they offer it because I want to experience the chef's vision. M. Wells' vision for instance (grilled onions, pickles, jersey ketchup, no cheese) was a friggin' revelation the likes of which I've never experienced anywhere else. Sorry. I digress. About Spotted Pig's burger. I think any kind of blue cheese is wasted on a burger or more clearly, it wastes the burger. It is too strong such that it masks the flavor of the beef. The beef was probably very good, but I could only get glimpses of it while roquefort assaulted my senses. Also, shoestring fries are not a satisfying fry in my opinion. I want potato-ey goodness not (again) glimpses of flavor. I'm a steak fry guy, though, so feel free to ignore my opinion in this matter. But straight-up: the burger was just good. Nothing special. Finally, on service and ambience. Very tight in there and dark. When the people next to us tried to leave, it was so cramped that the dude knocked over my glass of water. I was impressed with the staff's professionalism in cleaning it up. They removed everything from our table even though it was a minor spill, and re-set everything within 2 minutes. Crisply executed. Still, it was very cramped in there and not just tables. Dark and knicknacks and weird stuff on the walls, it all felt dark cramped and just wasn't pleasing to my senses personally. It was cozy, I admit, maybe this place would be better in dead of winter, but in early fall not place I want to sit for 1.5 hours waiting for a burger to arrive. We did not order dessert because we just wanted out. Luckily, Magnolia was close by and still open. Although they kind of had a sad attitude there as ",0

125780,1814,2.0,1,2013-10-07,"I was relaxing in my bed at around 6:30 pm and was ready for a nap. My girlfriend came into the bedroom and said, ""BABE COME ON GET UP! WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT; ALL WEEK LONG YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT THE SPOTTED PIG."" After 20 minutes of laying down I got dressed quickly and we were ready to go. I had decided to drive into the city from Astoria since the place was all the way on the Westside. Finding parking in this area was truly a mentally and physically challenging task in itself. After looking for parking for 45 minutes we were starving and walked over to the Spotted Pig at 8pm. Upon arrival to the Spotted Pig I then met our hostess or host? Sebastian. I nick named him Sebastian due to this Diesel Short Short Jeans, poor attitude and poor customer service skills. I do not know what his real name is but Sebastian seemed fitting for him.  Sebastian told us it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. We figured we were already here. Why not? We heard great things. I put my name down; he took my number and said he would call me. We walked around the city for a little bit and then stopped by a bar called the Dublin Pub I believe.  We got a couple drinks and then headed back to the Spotted Pig. We were hoping that the wait time was better. At 9pm we were greeted by Sebastian again. He informed us that it would be another 30-45 minutes for a table. His hands were flailing around and I let my girlfriend handle the situation. I was irritated enough already and do not do well in those types of situations. The bar and place were packed!  Every step we went people were bumping into us. Waiters would walk by with food and we were starving. Luckily I bumped into someone I knew at the bar that was also waiting hours for a table. My girlfriend would walk over to Sebastian every 20 minutes or so hoping for some good news. Sebastian was quite indifferent and did not seem to care that we were waiting for 2 hours for a cheese burger.  He was unapologetic and was doing an awful job. We FINALLY got seated at around 10:15-10:30pm. Yes we actually had to wait around 2  1/2 hours for a table!  The quarters were pretty close and we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us. There were a lot of tourists and asshole hipsters there giving us dirty looks. I am born and raised in New York City and do not care about you. We got our food at around 10:45pm. We got an order of deviled eggs and chicken liver toast for appetizers which were banging. We both ordered the burger that everyone ranted and raved about. I wasn't really impressed with the burger.  It was just a normal burger; the cheese was a bit too strong. The shoe string fries were normal fries you can get at Outback. My girlfriend said she would have preferred a burger from FIVE GUYS or SHAKE SHACK instead and I agreed with her. Over all the food was pretty good but the service and wait time were PUTRID. Sebastian needs a reality check and needs to purchase a pair of pants. I think it's safe to say that all the employees there need one (everyone else was wearing pants). If you want to get a sick burger go to the OLD HOMESTEAD. The Kobe burger is sick. It is expensive but you will get your money's worth and get GREAT service. You also won't probably wait 2  1/2 hours to be seated. I finally got home at 12:30am. 6 hours earlier I wish I would have ordered a burger from the Bel-Aire Diner and relaxed in my apartment in my basketball shorts for the rest of the evening.

The wait was 45 minutes because it is a tiny place. And it took them another 45 minutes to serve your order. My friend and I ordered deviled egg, chargrilled burger and crispy pig ear salad to share. Deviled egg is just a boiled egg with egg yolk blended in mayo and sprinkled parsley. It tastes nothing surprising as what most people said. Plus $4 for an ordinary boiled egg is just way overrated. Then the chargrilled burger tastes bland. My dad can make a better burger than them. Lastly, crispy pig's ear salad is way too sour. They must forgot and pour too much lemon/vinaigrette dressing. Also they literally served us a whole piece (uncut) pig's ear. WARNING: cutting that pig's ear is tough! Totally ruined our appetite. All in all, I do not recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice flavorful meal. Don't waste your time waiting 45mins for a table and end up with not-so-good, way overrated dishes.",0

We had some time, which we knew we would need, so we walked in and the friendly hostess told us it would be 1 hr to 1 hr & 20 mins. We headed to the upstairs bar for a drink and quickly got one, despite the fact it was quite busy. I think we got a table around 45 mins after we got there so not bad. We got seated upstairs in the little romantic corner booth so it was worth the wait. We wanted a little snack so ordered the Devils on Horseback which were packed with flavor. For our mains, we got pumpkin salad, pork cheeks, broccoli rabe, and roasted carrots. I was honestly looking forward to the veggies most and damn were they great! Perfectly seasoned and packed with slow roasted flavor. The pork cheeks on toast were succulent.     This was a great night and will be back, probably during the week though so I dont have to wait any longer than I have to do dig into the dishes here!",1

We got the deviled eggs, pickled herring, bacon wrapped prunes, ricotta gnudi, Swiss chard and broccoli rabe. For three people, this turned out to be just the right amount of small plates and I must say, the bill was also extremely reasonable too. The pickled herring was delicious, very refined, tender and fresh, accented with creme fraiche. The gnudi were also delicious and I ate them together with the Swiss chard - which I would recommend. The broccoli rabe was perfectly executed and not at all bitter. I was less thrilled with the devil eggs which were pretty standard. The bacon wrapped prunes were good but could have benefited having goat cheese or something to round them out. Overall, the service was attentive and atmosphere was relaxing and lively.",1

My friend ordered the frittata, which she enjoyed. I ordered the burger, medium rare. It was delicious! It was topped with blue cheese, so the meltiness of the cheese combined with the juiciness of the burger was perfection. While it does not beat my beloved black label burger at Minetta Tavern, I was not disappointed! The burger was served with shoe string fries - I'm generally not a fan of those kinds of fries, so I didn't devour the whole plate. Oh - one minor note - they don't have soy/almond/non dairy options for milk substitutes. Not a big deal, just kind of random considering how many restaurants do offer that.

This reminds me a little bit of Umami where they strategically make customers wait to generate lines and hype. Not a fan of this practice. I think the best way to describe this burger is ""grown up"". The blue cheese is very powerful to say the least, and seeing as I'm not a fan of blue cheese, I was not a fan of this burger. The brioche bun was perfect as was the marbling of the patty itself. I understand that the blue cheese is the focus of the burger's flavor, but I think the patty could have used more seasoning or at least some salt for the love of god.

From a gluten free perspective, there seem to be a few things on the menu to try, but I could never get a complete picture because our waitress was so non-communicative.  My wife - who waited tables when she was young and is sympathetic to most wait staff - thinks that perhaps this waitress was just insecure and/or inexperienced.  I thought she 's just say extraordinarily unskilled.  But after going back-and-forth several times over the menu with her, we were finally able to select some GF items.  Honestly, from the waitress' evasive comments, I don't know if they really were gluten-free, but at least I didn't get sick. That said, the corn soup with Chantrelle mushrooms was excellent, as were my raw oysters.  I also had the skirt steak, which was one of the best preparations I've experienced.  My wife had the pesto gnudi which she really liked.   With such interesting and delicious food, why would I only give this restaurant two ?! Well, I'm sorry, but knowledgable, attentive and competent service counts for something - particularly for us gluten free folks, but really for anyone.  Perhaps this restaurant can get a long way on funky decor, excellent food and a few 't been trained well, leave the table unattended, and mislead customers about seating options (yes, our waitress actually lied about where we could ), then the whole experience gets knocked down a few points.

125790,1814,3.0,1,2013-08-29,"It's date night! So the boo and I were trying to figure out a place to try and tonight, we decided with The Spotted Pig. And here's my review: ATMOSPHERE/AMBIANCE: All around the facade of the restaurant is what seems like a , so I couldn't really appreciate whatever esthetic value this jungle was trying to achieve; what's nice is that there places to sit while you wait, and since The Spotted Pig doesn't take reservations, it's perf (the wait time when we got there was 45-50 minutes). Eclectic items, with the recurring theme of, you guessed it, PIG!, decorate this dim-lit restaurant. Make sure to check the BIG mirror for the ""Specials."" Where we sat, I had the a straight shot view of the buzzing kitchen, *apparently the hamburger is popular. The restaurant itself is bustling, noise level is between medium to loud, waiters, hostess, barback and customers are continuously walking around. The noise level was loud enough that when we would ask our waiter questions regarding the menu, I had to ask him to repeat himself or he will have to ask me to repeat my question. The restroom is sort ? There's no separate F/M restroom. One restroom, two stalls and a sink. I was washing my hands and one of the waiters came out from one of the stalls, I hardly had any room to wash my hands after he came out. FOOD: So here's what we ordered: Devils On Horseback - Eh. So the texture is sort of , doesn't even taste like bacon. There was no flavor and there were tiny bits here and there of crispy bacon which HELPED a lot to break that mushy babyfood texture. What I wish they would do: whatever they are doing that leaches the bacon flavor out, STOP it! And please, try to make the bacon crispy, the texture is just not happening. Sweet Corn Soup with Chanterelles - SCRUMPTIOUS!! Texture was solid, the taste was solid and the Chanterelles was a perfect complement to the texture of the corn soup.*I RECOMMEND Sauteed Baby Squid with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil - DELICHE!! The squid could be tender, but the flavor of the dish overall is simple and refreshing. *I RECOMMEND Sauteed Black Sea Bass with Summer Squash, Basil and Anchovy - HMM...OK. So, the veggies came out hot and the sea bass at room temperate (Whaaat?!). The anchovy pieces ruined the dish for me because a few of the bites I had were just too salty. The summer squash was scrumptious. The sea bass itself was cooked well (I was hoping the skin was crispy, but that's just me.) Halibut with Saffron Stewed Tomatoes, Lentils and Gaeta Olives - HMM...OK. My BF had this and he said ""it was alright."" The halibut was cooked well also. There were crispy bits, and we weren't sure what they were but it was a nice complement to the halibut when eaten together. SERVICE: Our waiter, Chris, was attentive and answered our questions regarding the menu. Our plates were promptly removed after we were done. Chris, noticed how long we have been waiting for our entree and assured us, after (at least it's what it felt like) 20 minutes, it's coming out soon. The wait time in between our meals was ridiculous! I mean, we took our time to eat our appetizers, more so than usual because we usually eat on a ""good pace"" (EAT MORE!-TALK LESS!-Savor when needed type of pace). After the Devils on Horseback, it took another 10-15 minutes for our Sweet Corn Soup and Sauteed Baby Squid to come out and 20-30 minutes for our entrees thereafter. (The table next to us, who were seated 30 minutes after we were, got their entrees at the same time as ours!!!). And to make our dining experience unpleasant, the difference in the food temperature was definitely a no-go! ABSTRACT: Overall ATMOSPHERE/AMBIANCE: 4.5/5 (since I was unable to communicate with our waiter well) FOOD: 3/5 - the plates were better than our entrees, overall missed the mark. I was hoping there would be more pork dishes available. SERVICE: 3.5/5 - it would be 2 but since our waiter was nice, bumped it up to 3.5, solely due to the grueling wait time in between meals (so if you do plan to try this place, make sure to eat incredibly slow, like chew that piece of tomato for a solid 30 second, or more if you could!)

I can see how spotted pig might have been great back in the day.  But the food here isn't anything out of the ordinary.  Their blue cheese burger is good, but if you aren't into greasy, gut bomb type heavy burgers you will be extremely disappointed.  I also felt it was too salty.  It tasted like the cooks sprinkled salt on top of the patty, and then put bleu cheese on top of it which made that layer where the two meet TOO salty.  But it is true.  It melts in your mouth ... but it IS like REALLY greasy, so be warned. I ordered the gnudi and actually REALLY liked it.  but i couldn't eat more than 2 balls.  It sorta tasted like microwaved cheese in a way.  I didn't get too much of the ricotta feel out of it, but of  course the flavoring is more complex with the browned buttered, but it's extremely heavy, and certainly didn't feel different than eating a brick of melted cheddar.  heh. Chopped chicken liver is good, but NOTHING out of the ordinary.  NOTHING.  out of the ordinary.  like, your favorite deli can probably do just as good of a job. Another interesting note though.  It kinda reminds me of Chez Panisse in berkeley. The set up is almost exactly the same, except the lighting is dimmer and instead of a cafe feel, it is like a pub.",0

The cocktails were refreshing, and we had a fabulous bottle of rosé with our meal. Menu highlights were a radish salad, beets and greens on the side, and of course the burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries. Since the table shared a lot of items, the bill ended up being quite reasonable, too. I'll be back next Fourth of July--I'd like to make a tradition out of it!",1
41394,1814,3.0,1,2013-08-19,"With a heavy heart, I'm updating to three stars, although really the Pig deserves two. I just can't click on two, though, not when I loved it here so much in the past. I'm hoping today was an off day for them, but in scrolling through some recent reviews, it seems like this once truly excellent restaurant is on a downward trend. All good things, right? As Vonnegut might write, so it goes. I stopped in for lunch after a morning wandering the village. I was seated right away, and the hostess was actually quite nice (before today I had never experienced a poor attitude from anyone working at the Spotted Pig). Unfortunately, the downstairs is cramped, and they seat most often down there; I've sat upstairs and it is nicer. I sat in the booth directly in front of the kitchen. My waitress came over, 't nice. She just exuded some sort of holier-than-thou attitude. Additionally, she was a terrible waitress. She dropped off my drink right away, and then I didn't see her again until the check. A different server brought my entree, and he refilled the empty glass that she quite obviously ignored. She read another table specials she never mentioned to me. Her attitude was one of supreme indifference. I wasn't the only one receiving bad service; the couple next to me had two waiters take drink orders, and then drinks didn't arrive for ten more minutes. They were clearly annoyed, but did not appear to speak much English; they ended up eating quickly when their entrees arrived and left in kind of a huff. I saw their point. Food has gone down in quality, too. I used to be able to order something ordinary, like a burger, and have it turn out extraordinary. Today I ordered the grilled cheese and, frankly, I could have made it. Disappointing. It gave me a few good culinary years, and it was always a reliable West Village spot for lunch or dinner, but I think the next time I'm in the West Village I'll wander past the Spotted Pig in search of food.",0

67073,1814,3.0,1,2013-08-14,"The Spotted Pig really knows what its doing and big props to them for that. It really surprised me that an eatery this crowded can be so smooth (maybe I've just been going to the wrong places all this time). Service was never a problem, food came on time at well paced intervals in the appropriate order, and although it looked so crowded and cramped, things were well arranged so I still definitely had a lot of personal space. I didn't order the burger (GASP). The small plates looked more interesting so between a friend and I, we shared: the deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, seared fluke, speck, pork rillette, and the ricotta gnudi. The deviled eggs weren't anything special, needs more spice. Don't know what the hype is all about. The chicken liver toast on the other hand was the best dish of the night. Incredible flavors and texture. I'd go back just for that. Worst dish of the night was the seared fluke with creme fraiche and mint vinaigrette. Absolutely horrible. My friend told me last time he was here, it was mackerel instead of fluke and since he liked it so much, he wanted me to try it. But fluke is a much more delicate fish with more subtle flavors and the creme fraiche and strong mint flavors just really killed the light flavors of the fluke. Horrible horrible horrible. Really disrupted the otherwise nice dinner. The speck was normal (aka boring). Pork rillette and ricotta gnudi were both very interesting and flavorful but also a little too rich for my too used to Japanese food palette. Pretty big portions, for small plates. Creme caramel for dessert was delicious. Would come back next time to try the famous burger and have some more of that addictive chicken liver toast.",0
18861,1814,2.0,1,2013-08-14,"I'm not sure how much future is in the stars for The Spotted Pig. While the 45 minute wait on a Tuesday night in August wasn't bad, given its reputation for very very long waits in this non-reservation accepting spot, I wouldn't have minded waiting a bit longer if it meant not being seated right at the kitchen door on a tiny little stool. That experience didn't make for a good beginning. While this place has certainly gotten its share of attention, thanks to its all-star lineup of founders and chefs, I think the light is fading. Everyone can have an off night, but when the famous April Bloomfield herself walks through the dining room, one wonders if she is too blinded by startlight that she doesn't see that the famous world-renowned burger you ordered medium is served raw. The huge pile of string fries tossed together in the fryer with rosemary and then doused with salt are good, but maybe not still worth all the media attention they have garnered. What else did we have? Oh yeah, a burrata with equally memorable disks of summer squash. A salad with a mix of endive and radicchio topped with long twisty bits of deep fried pigs ears was tasty, but a plate of cutely named 'devils on horseback' was, again, probably good in its day, but is now kind of bland blob of undercooked bacon wrapped around a tasteless prune. The black sea bass with grilled summer vegetables was spot on, perfectly cooked tender fish at just the right amount of doneness atop the light spot of butter sauce. The wine selection is not a focal point; the eponymous cask conditioned bitter ale is the right heft and temperature, but not hoppy enough to be called bitter. The room was funky a few years ago, but now feels like a theme restaurant. While the cool kids have all decamped to the East Village and Brooklyn--to be replaced by their distant cousins from post-happy hour Midtown--the upstairs room maintains a glimmer of its original trust-fund boho chic that drew in the crowds when the Spotted Pig became famous. If you go, ask for a table up there, that is if you can get the attention of the head in the stars searching for something anything please to back up this attitude I'm trying to throw at you hostess to seat you there. But then you have to deal with the bartender. Hey dude, ignoring people waiting to order a drink while you talk for 10 minutes to your tattooed long-haired rocker friend doesn't make you cool, it just makes you rude.",0

Loved the fries but honestly, the burger I had at the Shake Shack was better.  Nothing was amazing. Maybe I went in with too high of expectations, but I think it was underwhelming. Or - maybe it was the smug, unenthusiastic service. Our server was irritated by our presence. It was a late Monday afternoon - we ordered drinks, appetizers, 'd be excited. No real recs on the food - as if I was supposed to know what they all tasted like. She dropped by the table every 10-to-15 to show how annoyed she was to be working. We were not allowed to order appetizers while we decided on the rest of the meal and sorta shamed for not knowing what we wanted immediately and actually have questions about the menu.   My tipping point was the tip. Split by credit card and cash,  the waitress just assumed that the 30 percent cash was hers and charged the rest to the card as if she had done something  - like be civil to deserve it.  I would have been able to overlook the mistake but again - her response to my questioning was just snotty ,  so I made her reverse it. I waited after college and in grad so I am a big tipper. But, nobody has ever overpaid me to do a shitty job so I am not likely to return the favor.  I wish I had not tipped her but the previous server in me could not do it.",0

Then a burger requested medium came out rare. Not even rare, more like what the French call blue -- nicely browned on the outside but RAW on the inside. When we sent it back they brought out the SAME burger, which they had returned to the grill even though it was cut in half. Of course it was gray and disgusting on the outside. Asked for the manager after waiter told use that Spotted Pig had a Michelin star so ""I think we know how to cook a burger."" He also muttered ""It's not my fault I just bring out the food."" When the manager came over -- he and the waiter were lame hipster friends -- he told us if we didn't like it we could leave. I think they were trying to be snobby but they reminded me of Beavis and Butthead -- a couple of clowns in fedoras. Did I mention we were surrounded by tourists, like really tourists, from the Midwest, carrying things like bags from Dylan's Candybar? Not that I have anything against tourists, but I didn't get why Beavis and Butthead thought they were too cool for school, since The Spotted Pig seems to have degenerated into the Hard Rock Cafe.

125802,1814,1.0,1,2013-08-10,"I feel really, really sad writing this, but I feel like it's super important that I do, I've been to the Spotted Pig two other times, the most recent until today (8/11/13) being at least a year ago. We walked in this evening at 10PM and were thrilled there was no wait for a table of two. We ordered the squid and ricotta gnudi as appetizers, and the burger to share, plus two of the Spotted Pig's eponymous beers. The beers came out quickly (the service was NEVER an issue) and were cold + delicious. The two appetizers came out fairly quickly and were completely inedible. I mean, frankly, they were absolutely disgusting--it was absolutely shocking and incredibly disappointing. I can honestly say that I have NEVER been served something HALF as salty as either of these dishes. We didn't eat even HALF of either plate before we very politely and quietly got the attention of our waiter. We explained that the food was overwhelming salty --literally all you could taste was salt (the waiter seemed unsurprised)-- and that we wanted to cancel the burger. He canceled the burgerm no problem, but charged us full price for everything else, despite that we didn't eat even a quarter of what we were served. I want to echo my first sentiment: I'm actually sad to be writing a negative review for this place. This restaurant has been so, so good in the past-- worth waiting over an hour for a table for. Now, I don't know what the problem is/what has happened, but I feel pretty confident saying that someone else, who adores salt. is in the kitchen. Beware: we weren't the only table complaining about the copious amount of salt. I still can't believe that the food I was served tonight came from the Spotted Pig,,, it was disgusting.",0
125803,1814,1.0,1,2013-08-09,I'm not sure what these people are talking about. The burger is a pretzel bun with cheese and a pre-frozen patty.

125804,1814,5.0,1,2013-07-28,"We love The Spotted Pig.  It's our favorite NYC restaurant.  This past trip was our fourth, and each time has been memorable.  We always start with the chicken liver toast which is just amazing.  The liver isn't overpowering at all, just a nice hint of the rich liver flavor, not sure what they add to the liver mixture other than olive oil, but try it.  Also had the roll mops which were so tasty.  I love pickled herring, and this was as good as it gets. I had the burger for an entree, which was a simple medium-rare patty (you can request it to be cooked any way you like, but why would you ruin such a nice burger?) seasoned well and topped with roquefort cheese.  The bun is toasted and perfect.  Served with shoestring fries.  It's all you need.  Don't ask for ketchup or mustard.  Just eat it as it was intended and you'll be happy.  My wife had a prosciutto and ricotta tart which was perfectly balanced with thin prosciutto with a sweet ricotta on a flaky tart.  She said she really enjoyed it.   No room for dessert although the menu looks great.  I can only nitpick a little about the service, which is impatient and a bit hipster-ish, but they are efficient and knowledgeable, so I can deal with the lack of friendliness.  I'm not here to make new buddies for life.

5574,1814,4.0,1,2013-07-25,"On a quest to find the best burger in NYC, my friend and I came here on a Monday night for dinner. We arrived at around 7:30 and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table due to their no reservations policy, so by the time we were seated, we were both more than ready for our burgers. We also decided to split two appetizers - the devils on horseback and the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto. The devils on horseback were dates and pears wrapped in bacon. They came piping hot, and when I bit into my first one, it was mushier than I expected because I hadn't realized there was also pear in it. They were pretty good, though I wish the bacon flavor had been a little stronger against the pear. Our second appetizer, the ricotta gnudi, was amazing. We had picked it after googling ""ricotta gnudi"" on our phones and deciding that it looked pretty good (though we weren't entirely sure what it was). Turns out it's very similar to , melt-in-your-mouth ravioli. Our appetizers came out quite fast, but we had to wait a little longer for our chargrilled burgers (or maybe it just seemed that way because we were so hungry/excited). Our plates finally arrived, each one with a giant burger and an even bigger pile of shoestring fries. Unfortunately for me, I didn't realize that Roquefort cheese, which came on the burger, is a type of blue cheese - and I hate blue cheese with a passion. Luckily it was easy to scrape off, and I transferred it onto my cheese-loving friend's burger before proceeding to enjoy the rest of my burger. The meat was super tender - I had ordered it medium, but the pinkness actually looked more like a medium rare. It was overall very yummy, and I was so full by the end that I couldn't even finish the last few bites. I also loved the shoestring fries - they were salted and seasoned nicely, and the ketchup that it came with had some kind of tanginess to it that tasted a bit like sriracha. The restaurant itself is incredibly dim and also pretty cramped. While the food is really good and I would definitely return, I probably wouldn't come in a group bigger than 4 people.",1

99430,1814,5.0,1,2013-07-19,"I really cannot get enough of The Spotted Pig. I have never had to wait longer than 40 minutes for a table, though I know others have. However, all will say the food is worth the wait. At least, I have not heard nor read the contrary. This restaurant's decor is very unique, and I always feel very 'at home', particularly on a rainy day when I feel I could hang all day at TSP, eating Gnudi and drinking Salty Dogs. It is a fantastic place to chat casually and comfortably with friends, while enjoying phenomenal yet unpretentious food. TSP has created a menu where EVERYTHING is worth 't you?? The Gnudi can't completely be described using words, at least not without hand gestures or facial expressions. If you're at TSP and Gnudi is on the menu, GET IT; Gnudi = hot pillows of pan-fried ricotta. Hello.     The Nicoise salad is great if your desire is a cleaner, lighter meal. The Cubano sandwich, which is available for lunch, is an out-of-this-world Cuban sandwich. The bread, either baguette or ciabatta, can't remember, is toasted a bit overdone to crispy perfection. The sandwich in its entirety, I believe, is oven-baked. It is the best cuban I have had. TSP's specials are also stupendous. BE EXCITED to hear the specials from your server. It was here that I first tried Burrata, a soft Italian cheese much like a fresh buffalo mozzarell. (I have described it as a 'young mozzarella' as the outer portion is nearly identical to fresh mozt, with a runny, milky inside-center.) Can't imagine life without knowing burrata. Cocktails; TSP is a FABULOUS place for trying 'em all, and notably offering one of the BEST bloody marys. And their selection of craft beer is excellent.",1

I would've liked to finish it but I had to stop--I had like 3 glasses of water while eating it. The deviled eggs are amazing and I would've ate 10 of those for my entrée.

The Spotted Pig is more of a Gastro Pub than a restaurant and when you walk in, it's got that 'ye olde worlde' feel to it that transports you to England.  The surprising thing is this place has a Michelin Star and is very reasonably priced.  The food was lovely with the highlight being the 'string fries' which you have to try to believe.

I really liked the wooden/rustic decor and the fact that it has its own bar/kitchen in the room which really makes the experience intimate and special.

For food we split the roquefort burger with shoestring fries and the burrata entree. The burger was pretty good, but I found the roquefort cheese a bit overpowering. I also am not the biggest fan of blue cheese-esque cheeses, so take that for what it's worth! I have to say the burrata was a bit underwhelming (and not very creamy), especially compared to others I've had in NYC. We seriously get spoiled here with so much deliciously fresh mozzarella readily available!

There is nothing fancy or pretentious about this place. It's all charm and good eats! Service was quick and efficient. The menu for lunch had great selections despite it being small. DEVILED EGGS- very good GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH- BEST I have ever had. EVER. I did not want to share but well, I had to. The onion marmalade and mustard it came with were absolutely ""lick your fingers"" kind of good. CHARGRILLED BURGER- this was great and the shoestring fries were great too. I don't like roquefort but it was not overpowering at all. CUBANO SANDWICH-  I told them I was Cuban so they better deliver and did they ever! Better than our authentic ones down in Miami! Really! Go figure! We had plans to go for sweets elsewhere so we skipped dessert. The bathrooms are tiny, very dark and UNISEX which was really odd. You can't wash your hands without rubbing elbows with the guy or girl next to you. That was interesting. All in all, this was a wonderful little spot that is full of character. We actually strolled a little bit afterwards because we were so full. We finished every single crumb off our plates. I can imagine this being the perfect late night place too.

125807,1814,4.0,1,2013-07-08,"After an easy walk along the high line, we needed somewhere to feast, ending up at the famed SPOTTED PIG down in the lower reaches of Manhattan. It's an easy 6 blocks or so to get there. I couldn't find it till my missus pointed out the spotted pig above the doorway. And the 30 plus pigs scattered through the windows. We came in @4:30 and were seated immediately, though the place was still humming. The table was about the size of a toilet seat. Yup, two people won't get more than their plates on the table and a couple of cocktails. Service and cocktails were good, with the top cocktail using elderflower booze. We started with the chicken livers on toast which were as unaesthetic as you can imagine them, but tasty. Also had the rollmops; sweet herring with cream, onions which was great. None of these are show stoppers but well made comfort food. For mains, I had the prosciutto and ricotta tart with arugula while the missus had a Roquefort burger with shoestring fries. Both really quite good. They had ketchup and mustard on demand, but weirdly no mayo.  In a restaurant? Is this the best gastro pub I've been too? Does it deserve a rareified michelin star? While it was enjoyable, and cute with galleons of pigs scattered throughout, the answer has to be no to both. Space was at a premium, with an Asian tourist trio staring hungrily at us as they waited standing for a table in the middle of the restaurant. The food, while well made really isn't more than well made comfort food, at least at 4:30.  But I guess Michelin inspectors are as starstruck as anyone else. And why so little pork on the menu?",1

I didn't let him finish asking me when I said YES.",1
125808,1814,4.0,1,2013-07-05,"The decor is so cute! It has an antique home feel. We ordered the burger since everyone raves about it. It's a simple burger but I can see why everyone raves about it. The cheese was perfect and the meat in the burger is perfectly thick. The shoestring fries were amazing. The deviled eggs are the BEST I've ever had! It had this extra kick to it. And the chicken liver toast was really good! You can't even taste the liver. That means the chef knows what he's doing when he's cooking liver. We also got the ravioli which had this pop of cheese inside. When you bite into it, the cheese explodes in your mouth. It's soooooooooooooooooo good. I will definitely come back. We came on a Wed night at about 630PM and it was pretty empty. No wait at all!",1

8409,1814,4.0,1,2013-07-02,"Mmmm Spotted Pig, you did not steer me wrong. I am new New Yorker/Villager/whatever you will call it by way of my boyfriend, and used solely my Yelp prowess to find this place. That being said, I soon learned that it is extremely popular and well regarded. Hello, Michelin star. Anyways, being from Philly where I am spoiled by superfluous craft beer at every corner, I was really hoping to find an awesome gastropub with a noteworthy draft list of unparalleled quality. The Spotted Pig came up in the Yelp search for this criteria. Well, unparalleled beer list it was not, however it was an exceptional gastropub with a decent beer selection and other great beverages to boot. I'm still trying to find that craft beer haven, Manhattan. Crossing my fingers that day will come. Woe, I've become such a beer snob-I blame you, Philly. The menu was spectacular, just what we were looking for. Notably, the specials list was entirely worth perusing and honestly I think the large majority of items we sampled this evening were off the specials list. The whole trout was perfectly cooked, and the ""jar o pickles"" were just what they were labeled to be - a bar snack. And a perfect one at that. We ended up sharing 2 bar snacks, an appetizer, and a main dish, which was just a perfect amount of food for two hungry foodies. Also to note, that bourbon cocktail was damn good. If you like a boozy, bourbon based cocktail, it's a must have. Our server was a cute, friendly hipster lady who was very informed and equally as likable. She helped us out with recommendations and was always around when we needed her. We were seated upstairs in what looked like the seductive couples corner, which ended up being a really cute spot for us. Well played, Spotted Pig designer. Great decor, great vibe all around. Overall, an hour and a half wait on a Friday night was entirely worth it. I'll definitely be back when I'm visiting my man in the Village. And maybe by then I'll have my NYC lingo down.",1

Sure there are better food to get in NYC, but for the prices and the place itself, I will keep coming back as they have never disappointed me over the years.",1
15532,1814,4.0,1,2013-06-25,"Delicious Burger!  Ordered it medium and it came just how I always want restaurants to make it but they never, ever, do.  It was half bloody and half cooked, which !  It was delicious, bun and all.  Probably one of my top 3 burgers now in NYC. I wasn't too crazy about the string fries but they were still good.  I would personally prefer a thicker cut, but again, still very tasty. I had a Guinness which somehow tasted better with the burger.   The decor is very West Village so I enjoyed it's ambiance.  We went to the bar upstairs which I like better because it's brighter.   The place gets SUPER packed though, so I would recommend going earlier for dinner if you can.   P.S. as good as the burger is, it isn't the best value in town and quite pricey, but, wirth it in my opinion. $20 for one I believe, but again, soooo good. Enjoy!",1
56884,1814,4.0,1,2013-06-23,"The is a very cozy neighborhood spot with a lot of character. We (and everyone else) came for the burger with roquefort cheese and the shoestring fries. If you like roquefort cheese, this is absolutely your burger. This is what people come for. If I had a dollar for every burger that came out of the kitchen (I had a good view from my table) I would've had a free meal, and it's not a cheap burger. I would say a solid 85% of the dining room was eating the burger, I kid you not. It's very good, I don't know if I would say 85% of the dining room good, but very good nonetheless. To start, the chicken liver toast is a must, it is delicious. Also if you're an olive fan, the marinated olives are supposedly really good. They also have an outstanding bourbon cocktail, called the ""Fancy Free,"" which if you're a bourbon fan I would absolutely recommend it. We'll definitely be back.",1

All their highlights are quite true.  Their chicken liver toast is something you must try as it has a boost full of flavor and is quite tasty.   The food is delicious and the interior design is quite interesting.  I was seated upstairs and saw a couple of people from 30 Rock eating there also.,1

It wasn't oh-my-god good, but you can only do so much with a bleu cheese burger. It's not a novel concept, but the ingredients were fresh and it was nicely done. Twenty bucks for burger and fries is a more than I normally pay, but this is a Michelin star restaurant in NYC, so it's priced for the location and circumstances. In Arkansas, we have burger places that will run you close to $15 for burger and fries. As long as the line isn't ridiculous, I wouldn't hesitate to return here for lunch with a friend. The chicken livers are calling my name.",1

27416,1814,3.0,1,2013-06-17,"We were hungry and the unmarked door to spotted pig beckoned me.  Look for the small wooden spotted pig hanging from a small Ivey covered brick building. I had passed by early that morning and there was already a line for brunch, and the hoopla of April Bloomfields signless quaint restaurant appeared justified. The small place was packed but we scored a bar stool seat by a window opening to the street.  It was a great nook for two old friends to catch up over a bottle of wine. The oysters were brilliant (6 for 16) served with a pink vinegar sauce.   Service seemed astute to purchases, as the waitress seemed to drag out the delivery of our burger until we had finished our bottle and had ordered another glass. The burger was $20 and had blue cheese, it was good as you might imagine after having three glasses of wine.  Shoestring fries always frustrate me.  It's like disguising the sinfulness of the French fry, but without a lot of satisfaction, like eating air, or breadcrumbs. Spotted pig is a cute gastro pub with a small menu.   The menu seemed over priced and the dishes looked kind of boring, but we stuck to wine and ordered fairly successfully, more of a drinking place really with good snacks. This place reminds me of the Longman Eagle in Chicago. It's a casual Michelin star place, but while Longman is hipster Spotted Pig is pseudo pub with less of a value.",0
125811,1814,4.0,1,2013-06-16,A ludicrous amount of fries served with the burger but delicious. The rillette also worth a try.,1

There are some more dishes we tried like the duck liver toast and steak burger with goat cheese! Their menu were quite special and i think its also a good place to chit chat with your friends as there is a bar table on the second floor. Overall i think the service of the waitress and reception are good too!,1
48721,1814,1.0,1,2013-06-12,"I was so disappointed by my visit here. The first time I came- last year- was amazing. I raved about this restaurant and the burger to everyone. I came back over the weekend and it was awful. The nudi was still delicious- but my burger was raw. There was barely any coloring on the meat- almost as if someone just set it on a grill for a few seconds on each side. I enjoy a bloody burger but this was inedible. I could have eaten this burger without teeth- just gummed my way through. Now typically I would tell my server- but I couldn't find him. Someone took our drink order, someone else the food, someone different dropped it off. None of them checked on us.  I finally went to the bar to find someone to close out my tab and just left. So sad.",0
93091,1814,4.0,1,2013-06-11,"The burgers easily earn their Michelin star, but the place is not big enough to serve all of its fans. It frequently takes an hour to get a table and another 30 min to get your food. For those who want to try the food, leave your name then have a drink 20 feet away at Turks and Frogs. They'll call you when your table is ready.",1
47400,1814,4.0,1,2013-06-10,"I finally made it to spotted pig, after years of having it on my list of places to eat. We came here right when it opened for the night, so the wait time wasn't bad, and we had a few drinks at the bar while they set our table.  To start, we had the chicken liver toast, deviled eggs, devils on horseback, and the gnudi.  I really enjoyed the chicken liver--and I would recommend it even to people who dont like chicken liver.  The other 3 dishes were good, but nothing to rave about. For my main, I (of course) had the burger.  It was perfectly, perfectly cooked and had a good balance of flavors, but I felt that the meat itself could have been ground/packed a little less tighly.  My only other complaint would be that the fries are so thin, they reminded me of potato stix.  I really enjoy shoestring fries, and fries are in fact one of my favorite foods, but I wanted a little more potato texture/flavor from these fries.  They were incredibly crunchy, but I would've liked them to be a hair thicker. I'm not sure that anything as hyped up as the burger here could truly live up to the hype--but that's not to say that the food here isn't very good.  I enjoyed the food here, and if this weren't a city with a hundred other good restaurants, I'm sure I'd come back again soon.",1

My brother is an intern at the Spotted Pig so the kitchen was quite generous, the service was amazing (not too nosey, not too distant) and the ambiance was exactly what I expected from this place. I don't even know where to start with the menu. Their deviled eggs and the chicken liver toast are MUST HAVES. Try their oysters, pork rillette, burrata and sauteed ramps. The hamburger is their famous dish, amazing!! Be prepared to wait, they don't make reservations, but you can enjoy a cocktail at the bar either upstairs or downstairs. Fun place!",1

It's a great choice for someone who likes their meat more rare and cheese super stinky. Worth the wait (which was about 30 minutes). Shoe string fries = fluff Also liked the chicken liver toast (4/5) - don't be fooled by its poo-like appearance I would pass (2/5) on the deviled eggs (bland) and olives (just salty, wish they had some kind of additional seasoning).",1

The hot plate was the only thing surprising about the burger. It was nothing special. Also, service here is a joke. I ordered the burger cooked medium. What I actually got was a nearly raw burger. When we asked our server, the answer we received was "" Our medium is like this."" He did not offer to recook the burger or any apology. To sum up, this was one of the worst dining experience I have ever had. So I want to give only 1 star to this restaurant. What a shame for Michelin star ",0
125816,1814,5.0,1,2013-05-30,"Holy Crap. I have always wanted to go to the Spotted Pig, and for my birthday my girlfriend brought me out there. What a place. We showed up around 6:15 and were seated immediately, which was nice and surprising due to the fact that everything i read before mentioned the long wait times. Sitting down, we looked at the menu and decided to go with a few starters and then dinner. Our server informed us of the specials, a soft shell crab appetizer and a braised rabbit leg dinner. To start we had the soft shell crab, a plate of oysters, and of course the chicken liver toast. The CLT was so rich creamy with a wonderful crunch. It was just as good as everyone claimed it to be. The oysters were very good, growing up on the shore I get very picky about shellfish, and they came with a vinegary sauce- so good that I'll never want cocktail sauce again. Then came the soft shell crab. It was so delicious, so juicy, so perfectly cooked that it deserves its own paragraph. If this is ever on special when you visit, please order it. It is so god damn good. For dinner, my girlfriend got the skirt steak. It was cooked perfectly, and was the juiciest skirt steak I have ever tasted. It was paired with beets and baby onions, which really complemented it well. I got the braised rabbit leg with spring vegetables. Before I elaborate, I am not a picky eater in any stretch of the word, but I am usually cautious when it comes to game. But, i threw inhibition to the wind and ordered it. I am so happy that I did. It was braised in a white wine sauce, surrounded by some beautiful spring vegetables, all making the dish better and better. The rabbit was so tender and juicy that i couldn't get enough. When I was finished I told the server that I wish i could eat another one, it was that good. I will be back, probably going to order the cheeseburger (everyone around us had it and it looked oh so good), but I'm sure anything I order will be excellent.",1

It has a casual coolness that only can be pulled off in Greenwich Village. This is not a place to just ""eat food."" This is a place to have an experience. To savor a meal with friends. If you are in the mood for that, you will be very pleased. If you are rushing trying to get somewhere else you will ""special sausage"" to us.

I love the fresh flowers crowding the entryway. I love the vintage shop feel of the upstairs dining area. But I do NOT like being squeezed into a booth with a bunch of fanny-pack wearing tourists who forgot their deodorant. My odorous, gag-worthy neighbors aren't the Spotted Pig's fault -- but it still tainted my experience. First things first: The servers were great. Friendly. Not snobby. And they kept the French-pressed coffee coming. Our table shared the cheese beignets and pork cheeks to start. OMG. The beignets were sickeningly good. These puffs of fried cheese dusted with paprika were gobbled up in about two seconds. Next came the pork cheeks. UMMM, I think I died and went to hog heaven right there at the table. Incredible -- the pork was tender yet crispy and crowned with a runny egg. If you see this on the menu (I think it was a special when I ate there), GET IT. I finished everything off with the famous burger. Sorry to disappoint, but the burger is just a burger. Nothing to write home about -- and the crumbled pungent cheese was very good -- but a little overwhelming. I could barely taste the burger in my burger. The fries were a great surprise. I normally skip shoestring fries, but these were very special. I especially loved the whole slivers of garlic and sprigs of rosemary. Overall, this restaurant was on my bucket list for a long time, and I'm glad I went. I would not wait 2 hours for anything on this menu, however -- save that for something like Ippudo.",0

And, as silly as it sounds, the fries were SO skinny that they were difficult to eat and didn't taste like much besides crunchy salt and rosemary. The brussels sprouts, however, were really impressive. They were slightly caramelized and had the perfect crisp to them.",0

We were seated within 5 minutes which was great and since we were all still on west coast time, it was still technically 8pm! For appetizers, we got the deviled eggs and the shoestring fries. Deviled eggs were excellent. I think will try to make my own. A simple dish but hard to perfect. The fries were consumed super quick but wouldn't be gone for long. For entree I myself got the burger which I wanted medium and it came out.. medium! It also came with more fries (like a TON). I was a happy boy. The burger was super tasty, not a huge fan of goat cheese but I can live with it. My other friends got the lamb shank, skirt steak and the special which was a soft shell crab salad.

We had to wait over 2 hours to even be seated, which set my expectations even higher than normal. Then there was the food. I love cheese but I tend to like cheeses that are on the milder side, and the pungent taste of this cheese was not pleasant. I shared a burger with two friends and we couldn't finish it between the three of us. We also tried the chicken liver toast and that wasn't good either. It tasted off and kind of on the fishy side.

On any given night the tables around me are laden with the burgers: toasty bun, juicy beef, strong tangy roquefort. And those shoestring fries, so deceptively light, easy, fun to eat with the best-tasting ketchup and mustard accompaniment. The decor: pure kitsch. I love it. There is a pig motif everywhere you turn and hearkens me back to my third grade class and crazy Mrs. Mudra, whose classroom was an unbridled homage to our school mascot, The Bullfrogs.

21662,1814,4.0,1,2013-05-07,"Been here before, but I wanted to review a recent experience. My dining companion had never been before. She did not know much about the restaurant other than that the previous time we'd tried to get in, there was a three hour wait. This time, all good, twenty minutes and we were seated. Dining companion (to the waitress): ""So, what dishes are you known for?"" Waitress: ""Well, we're a Michelin star restaurant,  :: blah blah blah Charlie  Brown's teacher who knows what she said after this blah blah :: Ok, I get it. You have a line out the door every single night, you don't take reservations, the place is charming, the prices are decent. However, hope since you're ""Michelin star restaurant"" (gag me with a rake), hopefully you're not above some constructive criticism, but here it is overall: 1. Chicken liver toast: Fantastic. Just right on that crusty bread. 2. Deviled eggs: Also great, if not unique or remarkable by any means. Tip: my companion, who is gluten free, scraped the liver off her piece of the chicken liver toast and suggested I spread the deviled egg on it; there was still some liver on the bread. This was extremely tasty. 3. Pan Seared Halibut with pea purée & escarole: Perfectly cooked and delicious, crusty skin on the fish, pea puree added just the right flavor, was overall excellent. 4. Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with brown butter & crispy sage: WTF too salty. Quite frankly, not that interesting. 5. Creme caramel: Outstanding. Probably the best I've had in a long time. Service: Ranged from knowledgeable to overbearing. Knowledgeable: recommendations for dishes were good, detailed and accurately described dishes. However, saying that ""everything is good"" is just a pile of shit. Not everything at this restaurant is as good as everything else (see Gnudi notes above). Also, you have your preferences, I have mine, end of story. MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. Tailor it to your guest. DO SOMETHING. Don't just sit there and ride on your Michelin star. I guarantee you didn't get it through complacency. Overbearing: we were working on the Halibut slowly and also conversing, and we were asked twice within two minutes by the same server if we were finished with it. The answer was NO. Understand? EASY on that shit, k? Ask once, if they say no, LEAVE THEM ALONE for a bit. I've been a waiter in fine dining. Observation is key to success as a waiter in this class of dining. Just because someone puts their fork down for a second does not mean they're done. This is an example of a server who was not looking to see what was going on at the table. Ok, last but not least, NEVER EVER open your mouth under ANY circumstances and tell a customer you're a Michelin star restaurant. It smacks of insecurity (if not downright haughtiness), and quite frankly, means you've jumped the shark. Shut up and be gracious. THAT is fine dining.",1

Found a great spot by the window (great for people watching) and sat down by 7:30.  We ordered two on tap beers, the infamous burger, and the goat cheese with prosciutto as an entree.  For dessert we ordered the Lemon seasonal tart and flourless chocolate cake.  AMAZING all of it!! I would highly recommend going and will be back!",1

In all honesty, I went knowing exactly what I wanted and I had anticipated leaving the great review.  I love to go sample burgers across the nation and The Spotted Pig was on the forefront of the NYC burger ranks.   I absolutely recommend the burger with roquefort cheese.  The shoestring fries were perfect as well!  We started with the chickenliver toast which I have been craving ever since I left.  The only negative was that I asked for a size M shirt and when I got back to the hotel it was an XL.  My fault really but I had enjoyed so many beers I didn't think about checking!  So do check that if you buy one.  They are awesome shirts.

9306,1814,4.0,1,2013-04-18,"Popular places that don't take reservations are an anomaly to me. For   those that don't like to wait or show up early these establishments   can be a bane to their existences. I don't want to be seen. I just   want good food. If you like both aspects, then the Spotted Pig might   be for you. Here is one of the UK to NYC gastropub originators. This is upscale   bar food that rolls it's eyes at mozzarella sticks or nachos. The mere   suggestion of quesadillas might get you kicked out. Happy hour only   applies when you have waited for an hour and you are happy to finally   be sitting down at a table. All jokes aside, the food is pretty good here. With a name like   Spotted Pig how could I not order the pork belly? It was tender and   tasty and had enough of the crunchy skin on it to give it an extra   flavor booste. I read so many recommendations for the burger here but   I can't imagine waiting all that time for a table in order to eat just   a burger. Portions are a tad small and pricey but I know that going in. I've been here a couple times. Sitting upstairs is better than   downstairs but there's no guarantee. You get what you get and you are   lucky to get it. I would recommend coming just after lunch and right   before dinner so you can put your name on the list, leave, and then   come back right before dinner time starts. That's what we did. This place sounds like a real pain in the ass but the food is actually good. Don't know if I   would wait two hours for it like some.",1

My friend and I went to happy hour at a bar around the block before meeting up with our third friend, but when we got back to the restaurant at a little after 7:30 they were accommodating and had us seated in a couple of minutes. I got a beer, which I didn't love- so I switched with my pal - and the burger. We all got the burger. Now as previously mentioned, I had gone to happy hour before dinner. I ate this burger at the speed of lightning. The shoe string fries are ridiculously tasty, but I was so ravenous I kept biting my thumbs while shoving them in my mouth. The burger itself was cooked perfectly, but I found it a bit salty for my taste. I am not a big salt person so I could be in the minority. Service, good. Ambiance, nice, cozy- a little tiny but that's ok. I will go back and try out some more items, maybe while I'm sober.",1

I just love British pubs.  I can tell this place is amazing when it's packed on a weekday. So as you walk in they put your name on the list and you wait to be called. Our wait time was approx 30 mins. Not too bad. From what the other reviewers posted id say we didn't way too long at all. In the meantime you're able to wait in the bar area , which they have two of. One downstairs by the entrance which is usually packed or the bar upstairs which was not packed at all. Appetizers- chicken liver toast. It was good, but way too much of the spread if you ask me. I would tell them go lightly on the spread next time. Deviled eggs- excellent :) I had the hamburger medium rare, which was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Pretty presentation. Loved the grill marks on top of the bun. Shoestring fries were ok. I could of done without them. The staff was great. Food did take awhile to arrive, but it was very busy so it's understandable. Food was overall yummy. The chargrilled hamburger was excellent! The decor was so much fun. Kept up with the theme of pigs everywhere. Very diverse group of people. You can definitely tell this place is a tourist attraction for sure. A must go spot to checkout when in New York.",1

5620,1814,4.0,1,2013-04-08,"The Spotted Pig is a restaurant that immediately springs to mind whenever one mentions NYC. Not only is it headed by one of the biggest female chefs of our time, but it's also got big shot rapper Mr. Jay-Z as one of the investors. Add the Michelin star and numerous accolades it's received over the years, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who hasn't heard of this place. Not surprisingly then, The Spotted Pig is perpetually packed at any hour of the day with a line wrapped around the front door. The bar area both downstairs and upstairs were packed even after midnight when the bf and I dropped in for a very late supper after some shenanigans nearby. We were pretty fortunate, being a party of two, as we were seated at a two top upstairs immediately after checking in at the receptionist's desk. Even though this place is dubbed as a gastropub with fairly high-priced fare, the ambiance is straight up casual and laid-back. From the borderline tacky lights on the outside to the cramped dining room and bar filled with a million piggy tinctures and various other things, I was actually pretty surprised by how much it resembled a neighborhood pub. But of course, the food here is steps above what you'd find at a regular pub. The renowned chargrilled burger with roquefort is incredibly juicy and rich, generously basted in butter on the grill with just enough pungency and flavor provided by the roquefort cheese. The accompanying shoe string fries are some of the thinnest and crispiest potato sticks I've ever tasted, yet elevated by the addition of garlic and rosemary fried with the fries. While I personally would never be able to finish that decadent burger, just about everyone else in the dining room had no problem at all putting it away. Attempting to find a lighter option on the dinner menu, I ordered the prosciutto and ricotta tart with marjoram. The smear of creamy ricotta and thinly sliced prosciutto layered on the impossibly flaky and warm puff pasty tart had enough salt to satisfy a late night craving but still managed to be balanced. I also liked the marjoram on top, similar to baby arugula, as it provided some much needed herbaceousness. The chicken liver toast is no joke here either - creamy, livery and rich - made more interesting by the slightly sweet balsamic that the little livers are cooked in. I think it goes without saying that The Spotted Pig serves the perfect late-night grub. The drink menu here is well curated, everything from the popular cocktails, to craft beers and a smart list of wines. I was glad to see a number of wines from California, including a Sauvignon Blanc from Heitz that I found hard to turn down, as well as some California Cabs. I was happy with the 21st Amendment IPA from SF I ended up ordering, especially as it was priced surprisingly well. I'd be happy to come back. I'm not sure if I'd be able to tolerate a 2 hour wait on any given night, but weekend brunch and late-night supper seem like good bets.",1

125829,1814,4.0,1,2013-04-06,"What everyone says about the wait is true.  We waited 2 hours to be seated, but my friend and I knew that gong in so we are ready to have a nice long conversation and catch up at the bar while we waited for our table.  They don't take reservations but they do take your phone number if you wanted to go someplace else and come back later.   We order a bottle of red wine during our wait and the nice thing is that you can also order anything which is on the menu when at the bar.  At the bar we started with deviled eggs, roasted brussel sprouts, and the Ricotta Gnudi.  The gnudi was delicious.  Its a round pasta which is wrapped in sheep's milk ricotta cheese.  The moment you eat it, the gnudi melts away in your mouth.   I was determined to try as many items on the menu because everything sounded delish.  Once we were seated at our table, I ordered the chicken liver toast and for my entree I ordered the burger and shoestring fries.  The waitress said that the chicken liver was her fav so I had to give that a go.  The burger is the go to item at this place and I feel like I literally saw 50 plates of burgers/fries pass by me during our wait.  Both dishes were excellent and hit the spot of homey goodness.  I had to bring half of the burger home because I ate so much already but it was still good the next day.  My friend had the striped bass crudo and a pot of pickles.  I didn't try those but I probably wouldn't have ordered them because it's not exactly what the place is known for. Note the food here is definitely rich, but I love comfort food and if you do also you should definitely check this place out.  The tables are small and it's a tight place but if you like food you have to check this place out.  It's clear whey they got a Michelin star for the food.",1
87296,1814,5.0,1,2013-04-06,"This was the first time a burger *literally* melted in my mouth. Yummmmmmm. The place is adorable and has a great vibe.

As far as the wait goes, we were prepared, having heard it is always packed and doesn't take reservations. So yes, we had an 1 1/2 hour wait, but had a drink at the bar and then got seated at an adorable table upstairs. After hearing the burger was the thing to try, my friend & I both had to go for it. We also  ordered a side of brussel sprouts. All in all - the meal was amazing. Our first experience at The Spotted Pig was fantastic, and we will definitely be back. Hoping to try the brunch next!",1
20255,1814,4.0,1,2013-04-06,"I have a soft spot for British pubs and anything between bread, so I had to come here. Indeed, the Spotted Pig serves a solid, delicious burger, unique with the Roquefort cheese. They do give you the option to have it sans cheese, as the strong, goat-y flavor may not be for everyone. It blended well with the burger (at times stealing the spotlight), as its salty & creamy nature added another textural component and made the burger very dense. While I had to scrape some cheese off near the final bites, I still think it's a fantastic burger; the patty itself is still deliciously outstanding, and can be just as tasty if ordered sans Roquefort. I had mine cooked a perfect juicy medium rare, and the mild brioche bun pulled everything together nicely. Then, I'm a HUGE FAN of their shoestring fries! The abundance of rosemary (fried & edible) really gave them an addictive aromatic kick. Since they are hard to consume without looking like a barbarian, I opted to take the rest of the fries home for a late night snack, and I was so glad I did! Oh, we also got the devils on horseback. While Spotted Pig set theirs apart by braising a cube of apple (pear?) within each bacon-wrapped date, I didn't care too much for it compared to the burger & fries. I also adore the decor and feel of the space. There are pigs everywhere, and it looks like a cool (pig-filled) flea market tornado-ed itself all over the walls so that there is always something interesting to fix your gaze upon the crazy wall. The place also gets quite loud and (very) crowded as the night wears on, but I really enjoyed the mix of the crowd, which boasts all ages and all types of people. Only complaint: long wait! It took almost an hour for our burgers to come out. Our conclusion is that they just purchased the cow as we placed our order, and we had to wait for them to slaughter & age the beef. Thankfully, our server was very kind and gave us a bread basket because she felt bad we had to wait so long for the overall dining experience. Otherwise, I'll be back for the drinks & other dishes next time!",1
18686,1814,3.0,1,2013-04-05,"When I saw a guy roll out of a moving car run into The Spotted Pig to put his name down on the waitlist, I knew my attempts to get a table just got real. I was hoping that the hostess was messing with us when she gave my friend and I a hour and 45 minutes wait time on Thursday at 8:30p. I totally psyched myself out because we were seated at 10:15. Kudos to her for correctly estimating our wait, but I was starving by the time our table was ready. I loved the gnudi- probably the best gnocchi I've had in the city. Very soft and melts in your mouth, we cleaned the plate up. My friend was underwhelmed by the burger and thought the cheese was too pungent. I thought my sea bass was pretty average for a not-so average price of $33. And the shoestring fries? Meh, they're alright. I rather have thicker fries with rosemary. I'd come back here for a late night craving- the place had a few empty tables at 11p as we were leaving, but never again for dinner.",0

My friends all had the burgers, which were good too, but the cheese definitely overpowered the burger, which I didn't love, and was glad I got the steak instead.

Both were off the charts. Had the pan seared bass and braised lamb shank for dinner and we pretty much licked the plates clean.

My friend and I went there for Saturday brunch and waited an hour to be seated (which I know is typical in NYC on the weekends but it shouldn't be for a place like this). When we were finally seated, we had to share the same side of a booth seat, which means that we had to sit sideways to make eye contact with one another. Actually, it doesn't seem they own chairs in the section we were in, as a family of four next to us had to share one booth seat also (wtf?). I know NYC is a cramped city but DAMN!  Aside from cramped seating, the place seemed really dark and dank, which is ok if you're at a pub or bar, not a restaurant serving brunch. The menu was less than mediocre, had like 6-7 options, and was overpriced.  I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakeS... Or so I thought. Actually, you just get one medium-sized pancake for $15, no sides, nothing. We had to ask for the bill several times and had to flag down the waiter every time we needed something (which was only twice) b/c he never came back to check on us.

But, my party and i left quite disappointed with both the service and the food. The ambience was alright, if you don't mind sitting tight with whoever you came with (and perhaps even those you did not), as they will squeeze you in wherever, and as long as you do not mind pots of herbs in your hair (they have herbs growing in the window sill, which normally would be a nice touch, if only they were not scratching my neck the whole visit). I came early in the evening with two friends. The wait for a table was a good 30 minutes, during which time we were not offered a drink from the bar, but were greeted only with snarky stares by a number of the waiters. Once we were seated, we got to ordering quick, starting with the deviled-eggs. First mistake. The were completely overpowered with vinegar. We could not taste the egg yolks or the chives, only vinegar. I mentioned to the waitress that they did not taste good, only of vinegar, and she retorted, ""VInegar is one of the main ingredients,"" and did not offer to return them to the kitchen. Our mains were just okay. I ordered the fish and my friends ordered the vegetable platter and the burger. The vegetables were completely overpriced for the amount given and the flavor (somewhat bland), and so was everything else, due to the snarky staff, long wait, and tight seating. The kicker, too, is that at one point during our meal i got up to use the restroom. A male employee was in there, so i  waited a minute before i could get in. There are only two stalls, mind you, and the toilet in the stall i walked in was COVERED IN URINE. So, either that employee was pretending to clean up in there while in actuality doing nothing but killing time, or he is the one who urinated all over the toilet. Either way, no thank you. I honestly got the impression we were not wanted there. I will not recommend this place and will not be returning.",0

The place is fairly small with a ton of people everywhere so be prepared to get close and friendly with those at your table and random people throughout the restaurant.   The bathrooms are interesting 's basically unisex with separate !",1
125836,1814,1.0,1,2013-03-12,"This restaurant must be paying Yelp big marketing bucks-- they ERASED the review I left here two days ago. If this one gets deleted again, rest assured there are plenty of social media channels out there for me to leave even worse reviews. I was invited by a friend to join their Sunday brunch, therefore did not realize beforehand that this was supposed to be a place for celebrity spotting. Had I known this I would have avoided the place completely. We arrived at 12:00, waited 2 hours to finally get seated at 14:00, after seeing through the window on the first floor 5 empty tables staying empty for more than 30 minutes. Apparently both the management and the infrastructure is really messed up, as we kept seeing kitchen staff going through the main door and the outdoor basement entrance all the time. I understand how some restaurants want to create hype by making their customers wait endlessly, but this was downright hideous. Service-wise, the waiters were relatively pleasant, rushing through the specials like they were in a spelling bee competition, but service was slow. Nobody came to check how we were doing after the orders arrived. We waited for about 15 minutes for the bills to finally arrive. We left the place at 15:50. Food-wise, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich that came with arugula salad, dijon mustard, and caramelized onion compote. The mustard and onion compote eaten together with the melting cheese in small bites was pleasant, as the tangy flavors balanced out the heavy creaminess of the cheese. But honestly, as someone who cooks a lot, I'm not so sure this is worth $16. And $5 for a small glass of OJ... Or this thing they call ""shoestring fries""... It is a tiny place, and granted, we probably should have never been here for the purpose of eating. Perhaps ordering a couple of mimosas would have helped numbing us from feeling how tight the seating was and how clearly we could hear the people next table uttering every single word. (By the way, after we got seated, we knew there were others waiting outside; we just saw the seats next to us staying empty for another 30 minutes before they allowed more people in! I felt really bad for those who were still waiting outside in the cold.) Altogether I ended up paying $30 bucks, not too much in comparison with other places in New York, but very much if one considers the value for money and the opportunity cost. Bottom line, if you want to see and be seen and don't mind the wait, this is the place to be. Otherwise, spare yourself the agony.",0

Food (4/5) Burger has a blue cheesy layer and the bun in drenched in butter.  The meat does melt with each bite.  Not my favorite in the city, but I would definitely come back.

125837,1814,2.0,1,2013-03-07,"Meh. Following a lovely walk on the Highline, I have gone to this place probably 7 or 8 times only to find out there was a 2+ hour wait and abruptly turned around and left. The last time I went (and literally the last time I will ever go) there was a 15 min wait, probably because we showed up at 3 PM on a Thursday - and there was a limited menu on top of that. So with that, the place is small and intimate - intimate in a good way? Not sure. Regardless, there is limited seating which probably makes for the ridiculous wait times. The wait and kitchen staff are continually rushing through the dining area to collect food from the basement storage, so be careful if you find yourself sitting in the line of fire of shuffling servers and busboys. Anyway, I came here for the burger and was pleasantly disappointed. It was lacking in some way. The cheese was very overpowering and I would venture to say took away from the burger itself. The french fry strings were next to impossible to eat if you want to maintain a sense of class. Granted you get a shit ton of fries, but they kind of just seemed to be there for show. Lots of rosemary for taste, but overall, not that impressive. The chicken liver toast was pretty goddamn awesome, and a healthy portion too. I recommend that. Fo sho. But the burger was just plain, well, plain. I've seen a couple reviews mentioning Jay-Z as a part owner - if you're coming here for that, god help you, you sheep. Don't waste your time. If you can get a seat right away, try it out. If you are presented with a wait time over 15 minutes I recommend anything else in the area - it's the village after all, there's plenty of kitschy restaurants that are just as good if not better.",0

Very snobby when I'm paying 20 for a , my boyfriend (who hates blue cheese) couldn't eat the burger because without cheese, or anything else being added on since the snobby chef refused to add on ANYTHING we wanted, the burger was dry, plain, and not worth 20 bucks. Oh and did I mention the cardboard fries? Disgusting. If you go here, don't order the burger or anything that you want your way. The ONLY reason I gave this 2 stars was because the waiter was nice and felt bad that he had no say in what the chef told him to do. Poor guy",0
5453,1814,4.0,1,2013-03-05,"Co-owned by Jay-Z, this gastropub and celebrity hot spot was well worth the 1 year wait it took to finally get a table. I first heard about this restaurant in the summer of 2011 and have been waiting to try it ever since. Located in the West Village, on the corner of 11th and Greenwich, The Spotted Pig is famously established and is located on prime real estate in the heart of the West Village. Since they don't take reservations, and dinner waits are up to two hours, the timing had never worked out. A few Friday's ago, Kyle and I were off from work, and figured it would  be the perfect time to try to get a table. We went for a late lunch around 2PM. We still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, so we sat at the bar and took in the quaint and cozy atmosphere. It was well worth the quick 10 minute wait  to not only finally be at The Spotted Pig, but we also got a corner booth that I had my eye on. We started with an order of the deviled eggs. It was $4, and well presented, topped with a generous portion of fresh, bright green chives. They were good-- rich in flavor, but just a tad too vinegary for my liking.  Next, we shared the Brown Butter Sage Gnudi, which is a type of Gnocchi. After eating many plates of Gnocchi while while in Italy, my standards have been set high. This dish instantly brought me back to a Gnocchi I had in Florence. Not incredibly dense and overfilling, but so flavorful. The gnudi was delightfully savory- warm and creamy, stuffed with fresh ricotta and tossed in a brown butter sage sauce. The dish is then garnished with fried sage leaves and freshly grated ! We then shared their famous burger, served with a massive portion of rosemary shoe string fries, that resemble a cross between a french fry and a potato chip. Nonetheless- deliciously addicting.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium, served on a toasted, buttered bun with Roquefort cheese. Roquefort is sheep's milk blue cheese that melts beautifully on a burger, and compliments the smoky, rich taste of a burger with a distinct creamy tang. Spotted Pig also offers a full bar with craft beers and good cocktails. Great service, cool atmosphere, and reasonable NY prices. My advice: go for lunch!",1

26921,1814,4.0,1,2013-03-02,"First off, 5+ stars for the awesome website. I dare say I often fall victim to judging a restaurant from its website but this time the praise is well deserved--the FAQ section immediately addressed my primary concern: Can a vegetarian enjoy Spotted Pig? Yes!! Thank you April for thinking of us! Came here for brunch today and got the grilled cheese. There was a good number of other veggie options but i wanted to go with something British and it was as good as any Ploughman's lunch I had in London. The onion chutney was especially good. Wish they sold it separate :( At $16 it's def pricey but boy was it worth it. The mustards a bit too spicy and the side salad was over salted, but the sandwich itself was perfect. My friend got the Dutch baby and said the syrup was cold but otherwise good. From the looks of it, it's definitely more crepe like than pancake but the amount of bacon on it made it look more than substantial. Oh, There's a super cute art gallery across the street, and Myers of Keswick, a British grocery store, isn't too far away if you want to keep the British theme running.",1

Good beer/drink selection. Ambience: 2.5-3/5. Hour-long wait at lunchtime was mitigated by available bar seating. However, clearly understaffed at the bar and messed up both the order of food delivery and the orders themselves. Long wait time for the food. Offered a free beer by bartender but hard to make up for the wait and ultimate mistaken order directions. Physical ambience also : 3.5/5. Burgers/sandwiches were around $16/each, which is on the high end of reasonable but not bad. Chicken liver toast only $6. But again, burger wasn't great and neither was the service.",0

There is a small bar downstairs but was told of another upstairs. There was a small crowd but I was able to grab a seat and order a drink and the burger. Bartender was friendly and chatted it up even with the fast pace of other people's requirements.  The burger came out and was cooked to the medium temp I requested! (Which is so refreshing considering so many burgers I've had cooked twice as done as preferred) the The shoestring fries looked good on the plate but I do prefer a heartier fry that doesn't disintegrate upon handling.

7781,1814,4.0,1,2013-02-18,"Came here with a group of 6 on Saturday night around 6pm exact, and was told that the waiting list for a table was 2 hours. Of course our party didn't believe it. They were plenty of tables open on the second floor so we knew that they were pretty conservative about telling people how long they would have to wait. I'm pretty sure it's also a tactic so that it turns a few percentage of people away because of their no reservation policy. So roughly about an hour later we get seated upstairs by the bar. I totally understand why some people get a little annoyed at the seating arrangements. It's a little too close for comfort, but I didn't really mind it since I was with family. Overall food impressions? Food was really good!!!!  The CHICKEN LIVER TOAST, the OYSTERS, CRISPY PIG'S EAR SALAD, they were all amazing. I had shared the LAMB SHANK FOR TWO with a cousin of mine and it was phenomenal! I don't usually order lamb or eat it for that matter, but it was fall off the bone amazing! NOTE:*******I did try a bite of their BURGER that everyone seems to notoriously order here. Although it seems to be the plainest thing on the menu, that Roquefort cheese is mighty powerful, So I highly don't recommend it if you're not a stinky cheese person. There are so many things on the menu that are actually better than the burger. Drawbacks to this place? Service is a little long between courses. Torn between the Spotted Pig and the Breslin?

I do have to say that these are the best deviled eggs I have had so far.   gnudi: mouthwatering!! You must have these. They melt in your mouth as you bite in. Burger: Disappointment.

They don't take reservations, but since we got there right before they opened (and maybe because ""blizzard Nemo"" was upon us, we were seated pretty quickly. Our server was great - very fun and informative. A big pet peeve of mine is when you ask a server what the best things on the menu are and he or she replies, ""everything is good."" That is the lamest answer ever and most likely means that they have never tried anything on the menu. But when we posed the question to our server, he responded back quickly and confidently with his top menu favorites (which indicated that he most likely had actually tried the dishes). Some of us went with his suggestions and were not at all disappointed. The gnudi were fresh and amazing - perfect on a cold, rainy day and actually very elegantly prepared. My husband decided to try the mackerel and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. A couple of our friends got the grilled cheese and it was also good. The deviled eggs, while small in portion, were amazingly good (and spicy).   Loved the atmosphere and decor of the place. It felt so warm and homey. And the best thing EVER - the warm, spiced wine.

The come here, they eat the burger, leave, then write their review. Many are not absolutely impressed. Who wants to wait over an hour sometimes two, pay $20 for a burger and eat it jammed in the corner on a baby stool?   Yelp brought me to the spotted pig for the first time a couple years ago, I got a burger and those were my thoughts about it after. I posted a 3 star review and moved on with my life.  Now being back over a dozen times I must say that one visit and one burger for that matter is not nearly enough to from a solid opinion on this establishment. I have concluded that April Bloomfield is a genius and the Spotted Pig is my favorite restaurant downtown period. Her food it outstanding, I've eaten many things from the menu and many that have come up as specials. Michelin ratings are broken down by food, service and comfort. ( I think )  The comfort covers décor and the literal meaning of comfort. The spotted pig décor consists of ceramic pigs. The tables are super small close together and lined with paper the seating is almost all stools. The servers are on their game, they are often tattooed, pierced and without sleeves. No ties here folks. So this leaves one to deduce that her food carried her to the Michelin rating. If you have been once, go again, if you haven't been yet go and order more than a burger. Get there at 5 and be seated at 5:30 get there at 5:30 and be seated at 6:30 get there at 6 and be seated at 8.

After a couple of bites you either acquire a taste for the cheese and like it or you don't. I would of preferred regular fries. The shoestring fries were oily and very annoying to eat. I looked very silly eating them. Overall the experience left us satisfied. Take note the seating is very close. I tried to exit my table with grace and my backside almost whiplashed the couple beside me and I am a size 4! Would I recommend this place? Yes, for drinks and devils on horseback.",0

5613,1814,4.0,1,2013-01-24,"One of my go to places in the West Village when I'm in the mood for some serious eating and drinking. The wait time to get a table here blows so the best thing to do is avoid peak times and go in odd hours. Sometimes you can get lucky and get a seat at the bar while you wait but be mindful of the cougars. Last time I was here, this one cougar at the bar was eye-f***ing the sh*t out of my friend. They have a few goodies here. When I come here I usually go all out and order the decadent, heart-attack inducing foods so consider yourself warned. My top choices here are: - Deviled eggs - Chicken liver toast - Shoe string fries (if I don't get the burger) - Crispy Pig Ear's salad - Burger with Roqeufort cheese Look I already warned you - so stop making that face. Yes I realize the burger is probably the healthiest item on that list but it's a gastropub mate, innit??",1
28859,1814,4.0,1,2013-01-24,"I have been wanting to come here for a really long time, and finally had the chance a few weeks ago. It was a Monday, the husband and I arrive around 7pm and were immediately seated. The place was pretty busy, every seat was taken. I go to the bathroom upstairs and it also was busy. I get back to the table and the husband had already ordered some snacks, roll mops and chicken liver toast. The roll mops were ok, not my kinda thing. The chicken liver toast was amazing! It was sweet, moist and the best I've ever had. Next I order the crispy pig ear salad with lemon caper dressing and the husband orders the mackerel with sweet potato mash. Both were really good, the ears were crunchy, and the mackerel was cooked perfectly. Before the check comes, the manager comes and presents us with 2 glasses of champagne and congratulates me on my birthday. My husband must have said something. I have to come back and try the rest of the menu.",1

We eventually got in, and it was packed downstairs and upstairs, but we got very lucky with a spot at the bar. We started off with some bar snacks and a couple of beers. We had the devilled eggs, the liver toast, the dates wrapped in bacon and the olives. The stand outs were the toast and the eggs. The vibe of this place was real upbeat, and you can tell everyone was enjoying their food. We had a lot to drink, but eventually had entrees. My girl had the skirt steak and I had the Sea Bass. Amazing flavors all over the place. Would love to go back again this year. I have nothing bad to say about this place. We loved it.",1

We also had the pork rillette, which was rather good and a prosciutto pastry dish. The service was aloof, but hey the food is great.",1
11239,1814,4.0,1,2013-01-21,"Yes, I agree that the food here is good, but everybody needs to calm down - this burger seriously isn't the greatest thing ever as some people claim it to be. Also, those shoestring fries are absolutely worthless. I almost felt like this was 3-star worthy, but that was mostly because of the slight let down feeling I had after reading endlessly about this burger on every list of best burgers ever and seeing all of the rave reviews about the restaurant everywhere you look. But the food here is actually really good. Except for those silly shoestring fries (sorry, I just really don't get those). With the reputation preceding this place, I thought I was slick going on a Monday to avoid the crowds and the long waits, but no such luck. Well, we actually got there at a little before 1 PM, and had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which I guess could have been a lot worse if we went during the weekend. Actually, toward the end of our wait, we already heard the host quoting 45 minutes to an hour wait times even for parties of two. Insane. It's a very hip atmosphere. The stools in place of proper chairs for all the seating is always a dead giveaway for that. My wife likes a back to her seat when she eats, so she was pleased when we were led to our table on the second floor in a cozy little area of the restaurant where there are some benches for same-side table seating against the walls. The entire place also has a nice fun motif of pig decorations everywhere, from nice pig paintings to little pig signs on the bathrooms. The place happens to pull off a kitschy vibe while also being classy/hipster at the same time. So if you come here and don't order the burger, you are a failure. To start, it also seems like the other thing people can't stop whining about is the Deviled Egg ($4). This was OK I guess. Mad oily, and nothing mind-blowing (…). We also got the Chicken Liver Toast ($6). This was also extremely rich and heavy, but was delicious. Now, the burger. It's a really thick, sizable patty which is great. The roll is nice and thick and tasty, which is great, and very important so it can soak up all that juice from the meat and not get soggy. The Roquefort cheese didn't really do it for me. It was a little too funky. That little bit aside though, I do concur that this is a very excellent burger. But its not as transcendent as all of these other chefs and food bloggers would lead you to believe. The shoestrings fries are a real waste of time and stomach space. Aside from the huge pile of them looking kind of cool and making for a pretty picture next to the huge burger (…), they really have no culinary or enjoyment value at all. They're really hard to eat and are not particularly tasty. To even taste them, you've gotta get a good fistful of them in your mouth at once since they're so thin on their own, which is a real mess and pretty embarrassing as you can feel the other hipsters watching you make a pig out of yourself. Another reason I came on Monday instead of the weekend was to try the Cubano Sandwich ($18) since I love Cuban sandwiches and this one looked really good and they don't have it on the weekend brunch menu. It did not disappoint. In fact, this might have been even more enjoyable than the burger for me, though it came with an equally forgettable side that was also a waste of time, some greens dressed in oil. Lastly, we ended with the Banoffee Pie ($8) (…). This was truly incredible. Composed of layers of dulce de leche, pastry cream, sliced bananas and whipped cream, this really shows that they know what they're doing here. One of the tastiest desserts I've had. This probably sounds like a lot of complaining for a 4-star review. But it's just that I expected more after all the hype. All of the food really is excellent. You definitely need to come here at least once to try that burger (don't waste yourself on the fries though).",1

13947,1814,4.0,1,2013-01-15,"This is a very tough one to rate, made even more difficult when I found out it was a Michelin star restaurant.  As a precursor to this review, the food was excellent, the restaurant manager Michelin quality, wait staff not so much, ambiance just short of a log cabin, and waiting to be seated inevitably just not worth it.  So with all those rolled into 1 review, a 4 star is justified because of the quality of food, and the way the manager handled a table next to us, and ultimately us as well. To start off, no reservations taken; it's a Gastropub so I suppose that is to be expected.  Words of warning, popular nights you can expect to wait 1.5-2 hours during prime time which is exactly what happened here.  If you're unlucky enough miss any space at the bar to wait for your table, there is a Whitehorse tavern down the street you can wait at.  Typically, I would say ""eff that"" to a 2 hour wait, but a visiting friend from CA dictated we wait and try.  Arriving and putting our name down at 730, coming back at 925 to check the status of our table, waiting at the bar until 945, we finally get seated at a corner of the restaurant.  Not the most idle spot to seat 3 people at a round table with a cornered bench.  I had enough waiting, let the judging begin. There was plenty on the menu I wanted to try, but we were 3 people who share, so the soup was out of the question.  We ended up with the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart, Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi, and another dish that was meant to be spread on toast.  The tart was interesting, but a bit too much of a dessert feel for an appetizer.  The Gnudi was excellent.  The spread, which I think was the pumpkin spread was ok as well.  Nothing really stood out between the three.  As for the entree, we decided to share 2 large dishes as well with 1 side.  The burger is the pig's most well known dish, well that was an obvious choice.  For the second, we got the skirt steak.  For a side, we went with the roasted brussel sprouts.  The burger?  Yes it is good, and yes I would recommend it.  If you force me to put it in a list, I would say it makes my top 7 in the ever fluctuating New York burger list.  The skirt steak was skirt steak, not outrageously done, but good none the less.  Good flavor and tender for this lesser cut of meat.  Alta has the BEST brussel sprouts in NYC, and these were ok.  It felt as if they were trying to get there, but haven't figured out the correct way to make them heavenly.  Seriously though, as long as the brussel sprouts aren't slimy and nauseating, that's a good thing.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and I thought it was very good for a ""pub."" Now what really made our night interesting was the table next to us.  3 middle aged women, slightly buzzed, ordering more wine, a combination for the ages.  When the order came out, one of the servers spilled the entire plate onto the lap of one of the ladies in plain sight of everyone.  Luckily her lap and jeans were covered by the cloth, but let's face it, there was spillage.  Apologizes, some cleaning, and the night continues.  Seemingly no harm, no foul.  At the end of the meal, when the check comes, you knew this was coming.  Apparently the dish was charged.  3 drunk women, rise up and defend your honor!  It started off as a civil questioning as to his mockery.  The waiter, who wasn't the one waiting at the table said he was informed she grabbed the plate and poured it on herself.  I'll give you a minute to picture that situation.  Exactly, just a preposterous accusation.  At this point, I would say more of the dining room was on the side of the ladies.  Now the manager comes out to deal with the situation, and hopefully ""clean up"" the mess.  She literally listened, taking figurative blow after blow to the face, all while smiling and never breaking demeanor.  First point was to take the dish off the bill, simple enough.  Second, she offered a glass of wine for each of the ladies.  Classy, but they denied.  Thirdly, the lady demanded the restaurant pay for the dry cleaning of ?  Not an absurd request, but dry cleaning jeans?  I must have missed the label that said they were Gucci.  Regardless, yes the manager offered to pay for the dry cleaning.  Fourthly, this is when the group over stepped their boundaries, they wanted more items to be checked off because they didn't like them, although it didn't seem like it when they cleaned their plates.  This is when the manager seamlessly transformed from door mat to bouncer, all with the same smile.  ""I'm not going to take off items which you have already consumed.""  At the end of this fiasco, the bill was paid in the most unclassy way.  The check folder full of money was left on the floor as the lady exclaimed ""Oops"" without any intent on retrieving it.  We told the manager she handled it exceptionally well, and grace under fire only undervalues her performance.  She offered us dessert wine for the table, which we gracefully accepted.",1

The bartender, in turn, then proceeded to ignore us completely for 10 minutes while finishing a conversation with two other customers. HELLO? We are customers too!!

Seared fish on sweet potato mash with pancetta; a really fabulous lunch, full of flavour and cooking of the highest order.

Maybe i should have prefaced this review by saying i'm from Los A, lettuce, tomato, or some other condiment on this burger. what an overpriced burger. ""fries"" these are shredded up potatoes placed in too much grease and fried up and labeled ad ""shoestring fries."" other problem , cute romantic ambiance that it becomes utterly uncomfortable. my bf and i were seated in the corner of a booth with a small round table. we couldn't really figure out how to maneuver the table, our butts and our legs so that we weren't constantly bumping each other and able to actually reach our food. The services was pretty crappy also. can't really tell who's the waitress and who actually is a customer.

My first visit to you, my friend was treating me since I treated her the last time we were at a gastropub.  I had never heard of you , it's blasphemous.  It was after work.  We waited that hour to get seats and it was worth it.  I was hungry and I ate every single morsel on all the plates your servers placed in front of me.

Mulled wine.  I told my server I felt what Harry Potter must have felt when he drank his first Butterbeer. My friend had two cocktails.  We were giggling. THEN, we asked for your special.  That night it was pork cheek on toast.  Double Yum.  First orgasm. We were squealing.  Like spotted pigs? Maybe, but let's not get into that.

Perfect. Quiet. We ate quietly. We savored every juice from the meat, the beets, the broth, the pork.  We took our time with our entrées.  Quiet orgasms.

Don't get me wrong the food is good, but it's not worth the price. A coworker suggested we go down to this place one night. Once we got there, there was a bit of a wait so we just 'hung out' by the bar until two bar tops came available. We ordered a bottle of wine because it was about $2 cheaper to buy by the glass. I ordered a dish with calamari and a side of the shoestring fries. The fries come out like a small mountain atop of the plate- they look as delicious as they taste. The bartender was somewhat attentive. It is a pretty happening place so I guess there were far more interesting things to keep their attention. Although my glass did stay empty for at least ten minutes, which is disappointing in this kind of setting. The look- The Spotted Pig is kind of cool looking. The outside, first off, is darling with Ivy vines going along side the building. Aside from the brick, it looks quite cottage in the middle of a city. The inside is fairly simple- bar, tables, booths and an upstairs (I didn't go up there though). So in the end, this isn't my first choice at all because it's not budget friendly.

No quality of food could compensate for the horrible experience with the service. Towards the end of the meal, the table next to us spilled their beers all over my purse, phone and clothing.

13892,1814,4.0,1,2012-12-24,"The Spotted Pig, if it were a Dungeons and Dragons player, would be aligned with chaotic good. The restaurant does not take reservations, and as such, can appear anarchic, but it does so out of a spirit of equality, not a de rigueur statement of its posh status. Dianne K and I arrived shortly before the commencement of dinner service, only to be informed that the list of names of patrons to be seated was created only briefly before the first round of seatings, and had not yet opened. Having thus gained relatively little from coming early, we considered getting a drink, shortly thereafter realizing the impossibility of doing so. The bar was in all senses of the phrase, spoken for. Our attempts to slink over to a space within earshot of the bar tender were met with enough reproachful glances to make me consider the likelihood of their coalescing into some sinister form. If planning to come here, however, one should not simply steel themselves emotionally. It is a good idea to test your physical fortitude as well. Amongst other things, I was bashed with: a door, a tray, a studded purse(kinky), and the lens of a camera. Having one's feet trodden upon and being in a perpetual state of jostling go almost without saying. You will wonder if the surveyors from the Michelin guide have their own secret entrance, shortly before being buffeted with the door of that secret entrance. I , thankfully, mercifully are shown to your seats, you will forget most of your harrowing journey. Thus, like any proper triumphant returned would, I ordered a hot mulled wine. The typical notes of clove, cinnamon and anise were accentuated by something I couldn't quite discern, possibly allspice berries. Regardless of the mystery ingredient, this was one of the more masterfully full-bodied mulled wines I've had this season. with the brandy and orange drawing out the subtleties of the malbec. Dianne's Corpse Reviver was a moderately refined take on a classic as well, the Herbsaint taking the place of a more pronounced absinthe substitute (there is no real absinthe anymore, hipsters. Get over it.) and leaving a wonderful anise aroma throughout the drink. After a few pensive sips, our chicken liver toast arrived. Rich, savory, and surprisingly firm, it was not entirely what I was expecting, and I was pleasantly surprised. The bread beneath was appropriately crusty and warm, the smaller bits of liver seeping into the delicate lace of cavernous pores. Following the trend of simply prepared meat on bread, both Dianne and I decided to order the famed burger. The praise surrounding the burger is all well-deserved. Roquefort melds with the charred crust, creating a tangy, salty, creamy yet crunchy layer topping the juicy, slightly mineral, tender beef. The brown mustard served on the side is an excellent foil for when the proceedings feel too dense. This burger is a must-try for anyone who claims to love them, plain and simple. The shoestring fries, on the other hand, were not my favorite, though it must be said that I loathe shoestring fries, and did not have the highest of hopes for these. That preference disclosure aside, I found they fell a bit flat in the herbaceous department, and were slightly too salty. Ms. Bloomfield's culinary palette skews heavily in that direction, but the fries were flawed precisely because there was nothing to enhance or be enhanced by the abundance of salt. Instead, look to the more balanced items, such as the gnudi with sage and brown butter, or the stracciatella with roasted pumpkin and chili. Generally, in fact, excepting the burger, The Spotted Pig seems to boast more successes among its appetizers and its small plates. They would be perfect for sharing, if it were easier to come in a group. Time to befriend some rugby players, I suppose.",1

And then another."" - What I was thinking. ""Of course!!"" - What I said. The Spotted Pig is rapidly becoming one of my favorite lunchy/brunchy spots- definitely on the days I feel like wearing nicer shoes than I would to, say, any establishment in the East Village. Even when I'm not hungry it's nice to venture in the doors and up the stairs to the generally less crowded bar area (of the two). It's not stuffy but it is a well-known go-to foodie pub place, especially with the more seen-in-scene Manhattanite grown ups.   Cozy, warm, upscale, popular, really great hamburger, even better french fries. If that's what you're looking for you won't be disappointed. After, if you're up for it, check out Donna Karan's late husband's gallery space across the street.

After letting the waitress know and asking to speak to the manager, we sat at the table in disbelief for quite some time. We finally had to ask another server to get the manager, a second time. The waitress and ""manager"" who appeared to be halfway coherent, at best, didn't quite seem to understand the severity or the urgency of the issue. They kept mentioning that the ""woman in the kitchen"" who was in charge didn't know where the glass came from. I guess the ""woman in charge"" in the kitchen didn't feel the need to come up and apologize to the customers on who she just almost inflicted serious internal damage.

We would have both felt better after the meal if we did , it was worth the experience, but I would only return if there isn't such a long wait and if we score a booth.",0
47578,1814,3.0,1,2012-12-09,"Fine dining pub with a well-earned reputation and a tourist draw.  So why does it need the 1200th review? The Spotted Pig has done one bit of mischief that cannot, and should not, be ignored.  With a substantial out of town population visiting and keen to be well received, the restaurant prints on its bill a LIE.  It calculates on your bill a set of false ""Suggest Gratuities""  which are labeled as 18%, 20%, 25%, but that are really 9% higher:  19.6%, 21.8%, and 27.2%.  They are calculating a tip on the after-tax amount, which is never correct. First off, people, never pay above a real 20% unless the meal *and* service is amazing or you are dining alone.  Paying 25% is vulgar and undeserved (and, yes, I worked in food-services for many years).  Paying a distorted 27.2% of your meal is outrageous, extortionate, and asinine. Despite what the nouveau riche think, even in NYC pay 15% for a decent meal and average service.  Double the tax and round up to the nearest dollar for a fine meal and very good service (around 18%).  Put it in cash for food or service above this level. Don't ever use their ""Suggest Gratuities.""  Their miscalculating is sleazy and kind of greasy.  Thus, one star subtracted from an otherwise fine establishment.  I'll let others wax eloquent on the food and drink.",0

They have a young, talented chef making excellent works of arts in that kitchen. She's originally from the Bay Area and her creations come from the heart. She also adds her ethnic flair into each dish. Truly one of the highlights during our NY visit.",1
74817,1814,5.0,1,2012-12-04,"One of my friends really pushed for me to come here so I was excited to try this place. They don't take resies so the wait can be quite long - up to 2 hours. But we were spoiled. One of my friends live close by so she put her name down and went back home to change. We arrived 10 minutes after they gave her a courtesy call. Before I go into the food, I want to acknowledge the terrific service. Apparently, the restaurant policy is that they don't seat a party until everyone's arrived. All but one of us were present. But when I went to the host, he didn't ask and just seated us so I thought it would be okay. It was not until a little into dinner did one of the SP people come by to let us know the restaurant policy. But after I told her that we had gone ahead and ordered for the absent party, she was absolutely fine with it and let us continue dinner. We wanted to try a lot of their dishes so we naturally ordered a lot. We started off with the Chicken Liver Toast. When I order this dish in other places, I usually get two small slices of bread with a spread of chicken liver. So with that expectation, we ordered two dishes for a group of four. Little did I know that the plates would come out with big slices of toast piled - and I mean, PILED - with chicken liver. It was soo delicious! I knew right away I was going to enjoy my dinner. Next came the Deviled Eggs since they are much raved about. No giant eggs here but they are pretty good for deviled eggs. I wouldn't wait in the cold for this though. I learned that Devils on Horseback is not my favorite. It's basically bacon wrapped around some kind of fruit, in our case, prunes. I love bacon but I don't like prunes so I didn't like this dish as much. The Gnudi is pretty much like gnocchi with cheese inside. It was soft, warm and gooey (very cheesy) but very heavy. Our friend told us a lot about how his favorite dish there was the fried pig ear stuffed with mushroom. We tried to order that but they didn't have it on the menu. Lucky for us though, their special for the night was Fried Pig Ear Salad (apparently, they have that on their menu now, so lucky you!). My favorite dish of the night! It's a big triangular piece of fried pig ear on top of greens tossed with some kind of citrus dressing. The pig ear was fried to perfection - crispy and not too cartilag-y. I still think about it 't need it, we also had the burger and scallops. Super meh compared to what we already had. The burger comes with roquefort cheese (bleu cheese) and surprisingly, it was kind of dry. I had to take out the cheese because it was overwhelming my taste buds and I think I smeared some on my upper lip because I kept smelling the cheese the rest of the night, even after a scrubbing attempt. The shoestring fries that came on the side though were very good and crispy. The scallops were probably the worst dish of the night. Overcooked and underwhelming. Overall, a great experience. I love their menu so it's a definite must-visit the next time I'm in NYC again.",1

Words can't do it justice but let's just say that - there's little nooks and crannies with varying styles of decor - where I sat in, , there were french paintings on the wall ala parisian bistro - and outside, you had the counter-culture bartenders pouring pints of Spotted Pig Lager from a cask, and so on. and coming to the spotted pig lager, that was amazing - very easy-drinking and I would have ordered another if not for the extremely high price tag. The spotted pig burger was not bad - it's beef with roquefort cheese - the roquefort was obviously delicious but it kind of masked the taste of the beef - which didn't have enough flavour of it's own. What saved the day were the mound of truffle fries which came with generous sprigs of rosemary, which were a delight to eat in and of themselves. A nice place if you're around the area - Greenwich village.",1

The windows were open, the breeze was flowing and the server was nowhere to be found. When she finally did arrive, her contempt was palpable when I dared to order something as pedestrian as a Diet Coke with my lunch. Fortunately my wife got a beer, lest the server's eyes roll out of their sockets and onto our table. When it (finally) came, my entree was flavorless and small. At least there was cute decor to look at while we waited in our uncomfortable, cramped, second-floor table, far away from any other diners. I'm tempted to knock off another star for the presence of rabbit on the menu. Other people don't go around eating cats and dogs so why is it a-OK to serve another cute, fuzzy animal that lots of people, myself included, keep as pets? If this is some of the best New York has to offer, you guys need to step up your game.",0
65340,1814,4.0,1,2012-11-26,"My huge foodie yelping friend and I have been planning to try this place out for the longest time, and we finally got to. I love the ambiance of this place. It's super casual, and accepting of everyone no matter what. My friend and I kept laughing because they had hardcore rap playing on the second floor, and then it became like this hipster pot music. Super craaaaaazy. They have some crazy, awesome decor; it's really worth looking around. I got the frittata with swiss chard & ricotta, and my friend got the burger with shoestring fries. We decided to split the plates in half so we could both try each other's food. I actually really like the frittata. It's super eggy, and the ricotta makes the whole thing creamy with a bit of bite, along with the swiss chard for texture. I personally like cheeses that aren't pungent, so the ricotta was a good choice for me. On the flip slide, that 't know what to think about it, even after mulling over what to write on yelp (yes I do mull over things to write.) The cheese alone is so pungent, that it was nearly disgusting for me. Even my cheese loving yelping foodie friend thought it was a bit strong for her taste. HOWEVER, together with the meat, it was absolutely fantastic. They really know what they're making, oh my goodness. I still would choose , the shoestring fries came with the burger, but they just need a whole paragraph for themselves. They come as these wispy fried pieces of potatoes sent from heaven, mixed with rosemary leaves. They have nice rosemary scent, which totally just blew my mind. They give you soooooooo much; my friend and I split them and we still munched away for I think, an hour? gossiping and eating fries. They're so good. I might just go there and get fries. Service was nice. I love how this place doesn't rush you into leaving. There's ample seating, especially on the second floor. Plan on coming back for (grr those fries~)",1

Met on a Saturday at noon for a brunch with 6 people in the fall - I was really worried about lines, but the wait wasn't too long at all. Not a huge crowd or anything overwhelming - I may have just hit it on a good day. Heavy, gastropub brunch with fun twists - casual, relaxed environment - solid service - good portions. Honestly was expecting to have a celebrity vibe experience, which I usually don't appreciate. On the contrary, felt homey and welcoming without pretense. I was pleasantly surprised. Would love to try for dinner.",1

Waitress was a bit rude when we said some of us were vegetarian and she was responded with ""Welcome to the Spotted PIG."" Since we came here for a birthday and had wine with us, we asked about the corkage fee. It was $35! We decided not to have our wine. I had the frittata with swiss chard. It good except it was too much and too rich. I wish it was half the size and that there was some kind of a starchy side. I have the stomach of iron and I actually, at one point, felt like vomiting. I had to eat some bread and fries to calm my stomach down. The fries (shoe-string fries with rosemary) are really amazing though.

As someone that's a fan of liver and pate, I had high hopes for the chicken liver toast.  But it was too salty, even for liver, and could have been hotter temperature-wise. The poached eggs in chorizo stew were interesting. Also way too salty.  and to call it a chorizo stew is rather misleading.  To their credit, the eggs were cooked perfectly. I tried my friend's french toast.  Solid, but too sweet, I want breakfast/brunch, not dessert please. Also, I don't know why the ultra think fries are so special other than that they're just frozen fries thinly sliced and wayyyy too greasy. The gastropub atmosphere was nice, I liked it a lot, but they need the food to back it up.  I think if the chefs learn how to put the right amount of salt and sugar in their dishes, this place has lots of potential.  For now, there is better, and cheaper brunch to be eaten.",0

8907,1814,2.0,1,2012-11-11,"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of 4 and we were quoted a 2+ hour wait. We got lucky and managed to cram ourselves in the bar. We decided to try a bunch of plates. I got deviled eggs, which were hands down the best I've ever had and I could sit there eating them all night. I also tried both of their specials. The pork rillete was delicious but please, please share it. The fattiness is amazing at first and then gets overwhelming; I couldn't eat too much of it. The pig's ear salad with lemon & caper dressing was good for the first two or three bites. The pig's ear is fatty but the acidity of the dressing helped cut through it-- the problem is, the dressing was TOO acidic and after a few bites it really hurt to eat more. I love acidic/sour foods and the funny way they tickle the palate, but this was like pucker sour. Like eating a lemon. I ate the pig's ear and left half the salad. I couldn't finish it and I'm normally the type to clean my plate every time. What ticked me off was that I asked the waiter at the end if the dish is meant to be extremely acidic. Obviously I expected some acidity because it is a lemon dressing, but this was pretty much inedible once the pig's ear was gone. But the waiter found a very, um, polite way to just say, ""didn't you see that coming? IT HAS LEMON IN IT!"" He tried explaining that the lemon is meant to compliment the bitterness of the greens, which I appreciate and understand, but he just made me feel like I ordered tuna sashimi and complained it was raw. It was kind of a turn-off and I was a bit disappointed that he didn't even offer to bring a different salad. I was very sad to throw $16 away. I did try the burger and thought it was good but certainly not the best I've had, not by a longshot, even compared to other gourmet/high-end burgers. The beef was really good and cooked perfectly, but the cheese was very pungent and overpowered the beef. Beef that good deserves to shine. I feel bad rating this place two stars when everyone loves it and it's a ""New York institution"". But if I'm waiting more than an hour for dinner, I kinda want to be blown away and I wasn't. I did try some of the other dishes and they were very good, but I wasn't happy with mine and I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here, wait for 2 hours, and potentially end up with something unpalatable-slash-inedible. Also, a fight broke out literally right next to us and the place being so tiny, we heard the whole thing. Paying that sort of money for food, I really don't want my meal to be interrupted by stuff like that.",0

If you'd like to be seated quicker, ask to sit at the bar. Both floors have a bar. Restrooms are upstairs, it's a bit tight in there. There are little hooks below the bar counter. I love the decor of the restaurant. It's laid back in here. We started off at the bar but as tables started to clear, our server moved us. That was sweet of her. She was friendly and quick. Service was not all that attentive but nothing too bad. Everything we ordered was memorable. The Deviled Eggs were excellent. Soft and smooth egg seasoned to perfection. The creamy filling had a slight tang. The Lemon Ricotta Pancake with Candied Almonds had a lovely consistency. Lightly crisp on the edges, fluffy/cakey middle, not too heavy and sweet. The almonds added a nice crunchy consistency. On top, dollops of creamy ricotta. Completed with a dust of powdered sugar and thin slices of mint. Gave the dish a sweet and cooling element. Highly recommended. With so many reviews mentioning the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese, I was a bit afraid of the hype. My fellow Yelpers didn't let me down. It's delicious. It's not super dressed up with tomatoes, lettuce and onions. The toasty bun is soft in the middle. The meat patty is nicely charred which gives it a beautiful smokey flavor. Juicy in the middle and well seasoned. The meat patty is topped with creamy, sweet, salty and smokey Roquefort Cheese. Simple and delicious.

125873,1814,4.0,1,2012-10-08,"So, I love The Spotted Pig, it is one of my favorite places in Manhattan and every time I eat there I am full and satisfied. However, very recently they made a crucial change in their restaurant, instead of Heinz Ketchup they have replaced it with some other brand which essentially tastes like tomato sauce. It is, in my opinion, sacrilegious. Please, please change it back!",1
105385,1814,4.0,1,2012-10-08,"My date and I came here for a late dinner before venturing out to play some mind games. It was exciting walking in knowing that this was an establishment co-owned by Jay-Z. Seriously, when you look at Jay-Z and you try to think of food, what do you get? Well, I'll tell you what I didn't get. I didn't expect the pomme frittes to be so cruncy on the outside yet so soft and buttery on the inside. There was so much of it that despite us both attacking the plate from two sides, we couldn't finish it. We ordered a few plates to try and was pleased with all of them. They were exotic and adventurous, but nothing that I would think twice about trying. The decor was dark and romantic. The music wasn't too loud. Despite the busy crowd, the waiters were very attentive. Overall, I left with a happy tummy. What makes this review a 5-star was what happened afterward. So my date and I went to Fat Cat afterward to play chess. We walked , we decided to leave for the night. I decided to call my friends in the area and met up with them; ditching my now kind of creepy date after a few drinks.  Only then, did I realize I've lost my wallet but still have my phone. My friends came to my rescue and we decided to look for my wallet. This is now 3am on a Friday night. We walked around aimlessly because my phone has died at this point and with no one sober, direction became a blur. After an hour of wondering, I finally saw the restaurant.. The guys in the restuarant were cleaning up at this point and was startled by me pounding on the glass door. Finally someone came close enough for me to scream I think I may have left my purse in there. He opened and asked me to describe it. He finally lead me upstairs into the employees' secret chamber and gave me my wallet (I promised I wouldn't dish out on this secret chamber). Nothing was taken from it. My cards, cash, everything, still in there. Dear Spotted Pig, I love you for your food, decor, and mostly, I love you for your people. :)",1

Had the chicken liver toast and it was OK but better than other places I've tried. Ordered the grilled skirt steak - it came in salad form so it was less steak than what I expected but was very good and filling. The drinks were really good too, my favorite was the 'commonwealth cup"", came with a couple of cucumber slices. Overall had a great experience but just hoped for the food to be a bit better.",1

70221,1814,1.0,1,2012-09-04,"awful, salty and overrated. The three words that best describe this place. Not sure what all the hype is about, as I don't really appreciate 1) being treated rudely by the maitre-d who for some reason thinks they are better than you (ah excuse me you work in a RESTAURANT) 2) waiting 45 minutes on a tuesday night when I am told it is a 20 minute wait and 3) being served something so salty is was uneatable. I am not sure if it is just an american palette that jut LOVES a sodium fuelled meal, or if its just people that have low expectations. But I was so unimpressed that I would have actually rather a Big Mac, and thats saying somethings as the last time I ate McDonalds was 10 years ago. What disappoints me is myself. I should have seen all the photos of a sugary bun with a salty blue cheese and patty. ah is that all? when I tried to order salad instead of fires i was told 'no substitutions'. great gooooood customer service. And WHAT is with the obsession with those stupid stick like things they call 'fries'? they are like small strips of cardboard covered in MORE salt and piled so high its stupid. So if you like so much salt your lips tingle, warm beer, slow service and deep fried twigs, by all means knock yourself out, just don't go in with high expectations and you wont be disappointed. I just don't get it, and it makes me sad.",0

Pork belly was a major disappointment. The broth and pork belly was not cooked together so the pork belly was really dry. Flavor was okay for pork belly.

28912,1814,4.0,1,2012-09-01,"My favorite dishes here were the deviled eggs and the vegetable platter. Unfortunately, I could never again justify paying $4 for ONE egg, even if it's deviled. $4 should buy you two dozen eggs! The veggies are amazing, especially the roasted carrots. How you ask? It is cooked/roasted to perfection and sprinkled with fresh herbs. I could've finished the platter by myself, but sadly I had to share. My entree was the special for the day w/ crispy pig's ear. Pig's ear is pretty common in Chinese cooking so I was hoping for something similar. That was a silly thought of course because The Spotted Pig serves British cuisine and of course the pig's ear is fried. Being fried, it just tasted very fatty. This is not to say it wasn't good, it was just not what I expected and I'm not sure I would get it again. I still continued to devour my plate. After reading all the yelp reviews for the spotted pig, my friend who loves blue cheese ordered the burger and of course, loved it. I am pretty indifferent about blue cheese so the burger was okay for me. It was definitely juicy but meh, it's blue cheese. The bottom line is this - It's a great burger but you won't enjoy it if you don't like the cheese. It's simple really. My other friend ordered the pork belly which was fatty and delicious as pork belly should be. I'd come back to hang out at the bar and order the veggies!",1
125883,1814,5.0,1,2012-08-29,"So damn good. Came here on a Monday night at around 9pm, during the last night of my stay in NY. Our friends came earlier and they said the wait was only 30 minutes, so we rushed over. However, by the time we got there, it was an hour long. The host wrote down our name and then also mentioned if we find a seat at the bar, we could order from the full menu! So we head upstairs and quickly find a seat. There are drink menus laid out but no food menus. I was confused at first and didn't know if we were supposed to order at the bar along with our food, but it turns out there is a specific waitress who takes orders for people sitting at the bar! But be careful not to try to order from any one else, some of the waiters/waitresses are rude as hell if you're not a part of their section. So my boyfriend and I order drinks and then we get started on the food. We got marinated olives, the sweet corn soup, sauteed squid, and pork belly. We originally had planned to get a burger, but didn't anticipate coming here because we heard how bad the wait could be, so we passed on that. Every plate was delicious. Flavorful, good presentation, all that junk. So we are finishing up our food and decide to get dessert. However, our friends who came by before us a little bit earlier that night insisted that we HAD to get the burger. My boyfriend and I are both pretty full at this 's our last night, we might as well try it. So I order the vanilla ice cream with blueberries and he decides to get the burger. The blueberries are cooked with Hendricks gin, and the ice cream is perfect. Best dessert. After, the burger comes out. The shoestring fries it comes with are really good. The thing I typically hate about thin fries is that it's mostly just crunchy with no bit of softness of the potato, but these definitely did not lack that! They were delicious. And the , with no onions, lettuce, or anything that's on a traditional burger. However, there is bleu cheese, mmmm. Also, a thing to note, a lot of the waiters/waitresses were really rude, but ours was awesome. I wish I could remember her name but she was wearing glasses and a sleeveless shirt. She ruled. Basically the food is great and if you're not picky with seating, just sit at the bar and avoid the wait!",1

I had done some research prior to our visit to find a good place for dinner and The Spotted Pig kept popping up. We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and had to wait for about 90 minutes to get a table, which was fine. A place with a long wait must be worth it. We walked around the neighborhoods and parked ourselves on a bench for about 30 minutes and people watched (Saw Adam Sandler walk by with his family). We went back and took a seat at the bar and ordered a few beers while we waited. When our table was finally ready, we were brought to their upstairs dining room. I had read some food reviews and was told to try the chicken liver toast and the deviled eggs, which were both delicious! We both ordered a burger, which was very good as well. The whole experience was wonderful and will be back very soon.",1

That was one of the only times in  NYC when the proposed half hour wait, really meant a half hour. When we were seated, the service was good. The drinks were better. I was a bit disappointed by the burger and fries, I expected o have my mind blown away. I was only blown away by the amount of saltiness of my dish. The Mrs.' gnudi was a saving grace. It was soft, flavorful, and perfectly sauced. It was delicious. I should have ordered a pork dish, considering their title (and their wifi ). I guess I'll have to get the pig ear salad or the pork belly next time. Didn't get dessert though. How could anyone, with Magnolia right around the corner.",0

I'll be back soon for one of their epic-looking burgers.",1
125886,1814,4.0,1,2012-08-23,It's tucked away on a street corner in the West Village and feels worlds away from the nightlife that typically plagues that part of town.  Pretty small space- some would say intimate- to each his own. I went on a Wednesday so I can only imagine the crowds on weekends. I'm not sure if it's still on the menu but the calf liver was absolutely amazing. I don't generally eat the liver of anything but I might start now.,1
7215,1814,5.0,1,2012-08-23,"This place is a bit out of the way in the West Village, but it's a must go to spot if you love beef and pork. I went here with a friend on a Thursday night. I arrived around 6:40pm, and the wait was only 20-30 minutes for the table. The place is small, well at least on the main floor, but it does open up a bit upstairs. However, i still think overall the restaurant is small and may be as small as Minetta Tavern. I know i do mention that sometimes great things come in small packages, and the Spotted Pig is no exception. For apps, we shared Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto and Crispy Pig's Ear Salad with Lemon Caper Dressing. The Ricotta Gnudi was made so delicately. It was a pretty refined dish for the restaurant. The pesto was fresh tasting, but it was a bit overpowering. I had to scoop off some of the pesto, so the freshly made ricotta could be the star of the plate. Overall, the Ricotta Gnudi was mildly salty and sweet, and it wasn't too heavy at all. The Crispy pig ear salad was bananas. The crispy pig ears were literally pig ears; they didn't even bother to trim the ears into small slices. The pork was perfectly deep fried, It was crispy on the outside, but when you bite into it, the juices of the melted fat just explode. The pig ears are salty and the tangy lemon dressing with mixed greens really complement the ears. The salad had endives as well as other bitter veggies, so the dish had bitterness, tang, saltiness, and multiple levels of texture. For entrees, my friend got the famous Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort & Shoestrings. I got the Pork Sausage special.  The burger was flavorful and juicy, even cooked to medium. The bun had great grill marks and it was buttery and toasted to perfection. The burger paired with the roquefort cheese was a perfect marriage. The shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. None of the fries tasted soggy. The sausages , so that was great too. Overall the food here was AWESOME, and the fact that the wait wasn't long was pleasantly refreshing.",1

Best deviled eggs i've ever had.  Not quite what I was looking for in a late night food binge but none the less very good. The servings were not that big.  The staff was friendly. They seemed shocked at our order and asked to get a ccard up front which is weird. But I guess it was a strange order. I apologized for keeping the kitchen open but they were pretty adament that it was all good.  Overall bill was $80.  Seemed like a decent place to take a date.  There were some attractive people there.  I heard its hard to get dinner reservations to this place but at 1am it was wide open.  Not bad but not ideal when you are looking for a burrito or pizza place open at 1am.

We were a group of four and put our names down at 7:30. We were told it would be atleast an hour and half so we left a number and header over to the Other Room for a bottle of wine while we waited. Two hours and two bottles of prosecco later, we got called back and swayed over. It was my first time sitting upstairs which was fun, its a little roomier than downstairs. We got a bunch of different bar snacks with our wine - definitely recommend the chicken liver on toast and the scallops wrapped in bacon. For our mains, we were very boring and all got the burger. I love blue cheese and really enjoyed it but two of my friends found the Roquefort pretty overwhelming. Everyone agreed that their rosemary and garlic fries were just fabulous!

Otherwise, I believe that the chargrilled burger here has been engineered to perfection. I love how the bun is slightly wider than the diameter of the patty, so I never have to deal with an inevitably imbalanced bun-to-meat ratio after a few bites. I love how the bun is thick enough to hold up to the juicy burger, but still soft enough to be oh-so-fluffy. I love how the fries are all crisp and no mushy fluff and flavored with rosemary and garlic crisps. I also had a taste of the pig ear's salad, which was pretty good, but Chargrilled Burger, you're the one I really love.",1

Having people eating at the bar makes it really hard to order anything while waiting though. On top of that the bartender was both sarcastic to my friend and served four other guests before serving me (even when I ordered before them). Our waiter on the other hand was super-friendly and the food was definitely worth to wait for. I've been told that the burgers here are the best in town.

I had the pork belly which was perfect. I don't know if I can say it was the best I ever had but it was very good. The portion could have been a bit larger but it is what it is. My lady had the burger, OK it could be one of the best burgers in the city it was perfect. We also had the deviled eggs from the bar menu, I have never had a bad deviled egg but these were very very tasty! We also did the squid and rabbit rillette special.

The food was superb: imaginative, flawless, delicious.  A real treat even for those who expect perfection on their palates. And this is why there are any stars at all on this review, since the overall experience was a disgrace: Greeted by an unsmiling, snooty twit, we saw our names entered into the ledger, and we were shoehorned into our overcramped little corner table only 15 minutes later than promised.  Waitress was brusque, uninformative, resentful of questions despite the uniqueness of some of the menu's offerings, and decidedly unfit for a job in the hospitality industry. Half hour later one of our party actually caught her attention and sweetly enquired after our brunch order and was given a brusque brushoff.  Food actually arrived after another 15 minutes.  It was, in the parlance of the day, amazing. Waiters & busboys here yield no ground to patrons; a diner has an easier time scampering across Broadway mid-block at rush hour than getting safely to the washroom & back.",0
125893,1814,2.0,1,2012-08-03,"It's with disappointment that I give so few stars to the Spotted Pig. I came here with a few friends for lunch after hearing rave reviews about the restaurant, and having had a great experience at its sister venue, The Breslin. We started off well, with a really delicious lemonade and friendly waitstaff - and were easily seated upstairs. Our waiter was very friendly and explained the dishes thoroughly, which was also great. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And it became apparent after about forty minutes of waiting for our meal that the food had been delayed or something, BUT we couldn't find out what happened. Our waiter was suddenly avoiding us (the restaurant was half empty, so it's not as though they had heaps of people ordering and giving them the run around) - seriously, not even making eye contact - and the other waiters on the floor were also skirting around us as well without comment. Eventually we were told that our food was ""on its way up""... and then it didn't come for another 20 minutes. This is about an hour after we ordered our meal. Not cool. Once the meal arrived - and yes, the food was delicious - there was no apology or comment about the lateness of the food arriving. I'd usually expect at least an apology or a reason as to why it took an hour to serve up a sandwich, but there was nothing. Zip. Zilch. Nada. It's a real shame to have had such a negative first experience of the Spotted Pig, particularly after having heard so much about the venue. Although the food was really yummy when we eventually got it, the fact that our meals didn't arrive for the better part of an hour - without reason or apology - put a real dampener on the situation. Sadly, I cannot recommend the Spotted Pig to anyone I know because of this experience.",0

I was slightly  worried about the wait since there are no reservations and lines have been known to be famously long. But thank goodness, it was a Monday. We were told 30mn, which really came about to 15mn. Casual ambiance inside. Smaller and darker than I expected. Hubby  of course ordered the char-grilled burger with Roquefort cheese. Those shoestring fries with Rosemary that it came with were the bomb! I'm not a deviled eggs fan, but with it all the fanfare I had to try them here. It was super creamy and full of flavor.  I went  with the Ricotta cheese Gnudi which was quite satisfying and filling as an entree. Decent service. Good wine and cocktail selection. I loved that South African Sauvignon Blanc on the list. Would love to go back for an actual pig dish (pork belly or pig ear salad) Overall,  the lesson !

It was torture watching all the burgers with heaping piles of fries leave the kitchen (and not come to our table)!  Finally we got our food and dug in.  The poached eggs and chorizo stew was very good and flavorful, and at least for me, the deep fried poached eggs were a novelty (albeit an unhealthy one) that I quite enjoyed.  My only complaint is that the portion was pretty small, especially for $17.  The bf said he enjoyed the burger, but it wasn't super standout, and the flavor of the roquefort cheese dominated.  I helped myself to most of his fries and they were SO good.  Well-seasoned and crispy shoe-string fries, perhaps the best I've had. So the food is overpriced and I don't think it would be worth a 2 hour wait, but my late brunch plan worked out well so I was quite satisfied.",1

I think it's more of a seasonal dish because I didn't see it last time I was there, but I may be wrong. If it is, get it! It's so good! Actually, everything on the menu is good.

The sweetness of the succulent dates along with the salty :) just works really well. And the tangy herring just cleansed the palette with refreshing finish. Would I go back for burgers?

Without the lettuce and tomatoes, its basically a heart attack in a bun. And that was exactly what it was, except it didn't taste good. I understand that if the burger doesn't have veggies, then the meat would have to make up for it. The patty was bland and dry. The sauce that was suppose to add a ZING to it was almost nonexistent. The burger itself fell apart too easily even without the lettuce and tomatoes. I had an incredibly hard time holding the whole thing together and just gave up towards the end and ate the fries.

The fries were amazing though. Not a single negative, and if hadn't been 90 degrees out today, I probably would have cleaned the plate. Service was superb. Not rushed and very friendly. There isn't a huge beer selection on tap, and I would caution against ordering the spotted pig bitter. It was really unpleasant. Also of note, the bathroom is VERY cramped, which leads to some awkward side-stepping while you stare pointedly at the ground to avoid the glance of the man or woman who was just making those god awful noises in the stall you were necessarily leaning against while using the sink. On the up, the bergamot hand soap smells amazing. I went to the bathroom twice just to lather up. Overall, a very satisfactory dining experience.

We eventually got sat upstairs in a nook, which was cute and comfortable. We shared two plates and two entrees. The two plates were the prosciutto & ricotta tart and sheep's milk ricotta gnudi. The tart was good though not particularly memorable. The gnudi plate had cheesy balls that tasted heavenly. This was our favorite dish of the night. The two entrees were the skate and the pork belly. The pork belly was crispy so that was an interesting textural spin on the dish, but I love pork belly and so I expected a lot from it, and I've had better. The skate was cooked very well, but it's also not the best I have had. The sauce of the skate dish had some confusing flavors.

It's still absolutely poppin', but the regular 9pm dinner crowd is filing out and it presents a rare window of opportunity for seating, either on the first floor bar or upstairs dining area. I'd gone to hear April Bloomfield speak earlier that week, and was able to get a copy of her book signed (as if I ever , as a fan, I can still admire.)  She's famous for her pork dishes, and as it's a gastropub, one should order beer.  I went completely off-script and opted for the Gnudi (pasta similar to gnocchi / ravioli) with pesto - yum. Super heavy dish, but portioned tiny enough that it's manageable. Tom is on a quest to find the best burger in NYC - The Little Owl and Corner Bistro are both top contenders - but Spotted Pig butted its way in with a strong entry.  Rare, crumbly, buttery burger with sharp cheese spread.  So good.  The shoestring fries are fine, but a little excessive.  It's served with what can only be described as a bushel of shoestring fries, and they're so thin, they almost don't taste like anything.  It's kind of like - ok, I get it, thin  Anyway, a small complaint for an otherwise awesome meal.

Came across The Spotted Pig and I recalled that it was supposed to have delicious burgers. And beer. This was a no-brainer. Went in and were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait but that we could go upstairs to the other bar. Kind of frosted my cookies that there were plenty of open tables, but I digress. We all had a beer, then were seated right next to the bar - so close, in fact, that my mom's friend Mary couldn't get through the crowd with her purse. Once we all finally settled in however, and the food started coming, it was all good. My mom and I shared the burger with roquefort and shoestring fries. Oh Burger Jesus, the fries! I could have eaten my weight in them, and we all loved the shaved garlic and rosemary that had been fried right along with them. In the end, we ordered an extra serving, just to be on the safe side.

The food & service are top-notch, but this place is as casual as you want it to be- no need to get dressed up to come here. They don't take reservations.  If you arrive around 6PM, expect to wait half an hour.  Later in the night, waits get up to 2 hours.  It's worth it though.  Grab a drink at the bar while you wait and soak up the awesomeness that is The Spotted Pig.",1

62428,1814,4.0,1,2012-06-15,"Amazing burgers! Packed place. Always. I have been here a handful of times, mostly when I am craving a burger. There is always a wait, but after dinner, I always say, the wait was worth it. This is a good place to bring out of town guests, dates, friends, or medium sized groups. I find it is always a crowd pleaser. I have never left here disappointed. The neighborhood and location is convenient, the atmosphere is fun and trendy and the food is great.",1
125909,1814,5.0,1,2012-06-12,"We were in town this weekend and were able to have dinner here at the Spotted Pig.  Between the five of us we ordered 13 dishes plus had a few extra, compliments of the kitchen.  Thank you chef for a wonderful meal. Everything was amazing.",1
13736,1814,5.0,1,2012-06-11,"I have to say that this is likely one of the few places in the city where you hear that there's a one hour wait and breathe a sigh of relief that it isn't two hours. Using the best logic (or worst depending on if the place is genuinely good or madly overrated), a friend and I decided to go to the Spotted Pig based on the fact that the wait was that long.  Thus, we were setting ourselves up to be sorely disappointed or happily fattened.  Thankfully, it was the later. As per Yelpers' suggestions, we ordered the Roquefort burger and the deviled eggs.  As an avid burger lover, this burger was pretty damn good.  Not as beefy as the Minetta Tavern BL burger, but I don't think it's suppose to be.  Where that burger showcases the beef, this burger is a balancing act between the salty and pungent cheese and the rich, juicy beef.  Yelp redeemed itself in the aftermath of the debaticle that was Takahashi. But there are cons too, the bathroom is horrible and co-ed (??), the wait is absurdly long, the place so cramped you can easily overhear the conversation at the next table, and the next table, and the next table.     So why 5 stars?  The fries, oh god the fries.  So many fries.  Sadly, I had not-quite-soberly consumed an entire order of Pommes Frites the night before and still had not recovered from my fried potato-ey goodness coma or else I would have devoured the mountain of the insanely good shoestring fries.  They are seasoned and so, so, so good.  Better than the Balthazar fries and any I have ever tasted in the city. Alas, I was going to an open bar after or else I would have tried the cocktails and cask ales.  The price for the burger ($20), was also quite reasonable.  Whereas I balked at shelling out $26 (or rather, $32 after tax and tip for the BLB), $20 is completely fine for a quality and well-constructed burger. All I can do now is feel bad for my cardiologist 60 years down the road.",1

You get jostled while waiting at the bar, and it takes a lifetime to order a drink. I know this is part of the trendy hot-spot experience and may make some feel that they're in the right place, but in my mind, it's not worth going through more than once or twice. There are plenty of great spots in the city that don't revel in the chaos they make their customers endure. If you do get seated: the chicken liver toasts were delicious.

Things to loathe: - The no reservation policy - The long waits for tables - The cramped co-ed bathrooms Things to LOVE: - The food - The location - The hog heavy decor - The cask conditioned house beer - The food - The service - The dual level bars - The vibe - The food!!

There's usually a long wait, but it's worth sitting at the bar grabbin a pint and doing some pretty people watching. It's pricey, but there are ways to work around that: For a less expensive experience stick to the bar fare and appetizers. Bar fare goes for about $4. Go for the DEVILED EGGS, DEVILS ON HORSEBACK (prunes stuffed with poached pear and wrapped in bacon). In terms of apps, don't miss out on the GNUDI and  PROSCIUTTO TARTLET (possibly the best pastry flake I've ever tried). The BURGER is the most famous, but nothing out of this planet.

Everest on a plate, just unnecessarily massive, yet utterly outstanding.  These fries were thin and crispy, salty and the perfect crunchy accessory to that amazing burger.  The Chicken Stew was quite sophisticated as well, and definitely very hearty.  The chicken was really tender and we really enjoyed the flavor profile of the dish.   Dessert was The Flourless Chocolate Cake as well as the Hazelnut Ice Cream with Shortbread cookies.  I wouldn't recommend the cake, it was extremely dense and rich, and way too much dessert after such a heavy meal.  On the other hand, the delectable ice cream along with the crunchy shortbread cookies, was a nice way to cap off our impressive meal. Too bad our friends visiting from Cali couldn't hack another burger night since that's all they had been eating before coming to New York, because I was planning to take them here.  Instead they went with pizza (which is never a bad idea in NYC), but I tell you, I really wanted them to try The Spotted Pig and have something else to really brag about when they made their way back to the west coast.  Next time, I'll get them and so will TSP.   The Spotted Pig delivers incredibly hearty, and tasty food, in a cozy and chilled out setting.  One dinner here is a meal you will not likely forget, and for all the best reasons imaginable.  Amazing food, great service, fun ?  Mmm that burger, Lord have mercy!!!",1

April Bloomfield's charming space in the West Village is regarded as NYC's first gastropub. But what had the Spotted Pig's name murmuring on every New Yorker's (and tourist's) lips is the famous burger. $20 will buy you a thick 8 oz. patty made with short loin, brisket and chuck, cooked medium rare and topped with Roquefort blue cheese. This simple concoction is sandwiched between nicely grilled Brioche buns and served with fries. Whoa! This is a great burger. It's juicy and packed with flavor, mostly from the cheese, but nevertheless, this more than hit the spot after a drunken debauchery.  But what really, really made me happy was the mountain of shoestring fries.  Endless strings of salty, rosemary herbed potatoes!!!  You pick up a bunch, tip your head back and let the crunchy potatoes sink into your mouth.  Sooo superbly addicting, we ordered another one, since obviously, one mountain of potatoes isn't enough for me.

For a drink I got a cask bitter, which was excellent.  I saw a couple reviews saying they had a great selection of beer.  I would not agree with that. None of the desserts tempted me, which is weird.  Maybe next time I'll try one, but I wish they'd mix it up a little here. The bad: We got lucky, but some of the tables would be pretty awful places to have a nice dinner.   Also, if you're worried about it, there is going to be a wait.  Not a huge deal with some nice bars nearby (the SP's bar is way too cramped to enjoy a drink or two while you wait for dinner).  As an aside, the hostess didn't offer to take our mobile # as they say they will do on their website.  Again, not a huge deal, just something to be aware of-not sure they really offer that service.",1

42865,1814,5.0,1,2012-05-15,"The spotted pig how I love you so. For those of you who have never heard of the spotted pig; it is one of the original and best gastropubs in NYC. Co owned and run by Chef Genius April Bloomfield. With the likes of Mario Batali and Jay Z as her investor partners. Anthony Bourdain is also involved by helping April with her menu. With ppl like Batali and Bourdain involved one begins to think who is April Bloomfield and is her food really that good??!! Well I ve never met April nor have even seen her picture but if her food is reflection of April and her inner creativity then I can only imagine how awesome a person April is. But enough about our beloved chef and on to her highly acclaimed food. The spotted pig is well known in burger circles as ""thee burger"" So of course my inner cynic laid doubt to the claim which tends to get tossed around like a cheap slut now a days. All to often do I hear a blogger critic acclaim one burger to be the holy grail of all, with the masses flocking like the sheep to just stand about for hours in lines which wrap around parks like anacondas around the next dubious victim. Lines that last no less then an hour and that's if your lucky. But I am not here to speak of shacks I am here to speak of a burger which in deed blew me away. You can not compare it to places like shake shack or 5 guys. This is a masterpiece which does not need ketchup or mustard or even the one cheese you are elected to choose. A masterpiece largely in part to a butcher named pat lafrieda based in north Bergen, nj. Lafrieda is a true master at his craft and a genius in crafting burger blends. Blends which he will not make for any other eatery. The blend that he has created for the spotted pig is truly outrageous. A mix which I have heard is chuck, short rib and brisket. It has a unique flavor one of upmost taste. A truly perfect blend and is cooked right on. A nice char with an amazing juiciness. The burger is laid between a grill toasted brioche which is the perfect vehicle to house the burger to is next destination - your mouth. The bun Is not overly thick or hides the burger. It has the right bun to buger ratio. Which is sooooo important but sometimes forgotten. The order comes with Magnificent crisp shoe string fries with crispy tossed garlic chips. To top it off. Thy have some excellent choices on tap. Last time they had old specked hen, which is one of the best British beers out on the market today. All in all if you enjoy great food or an amazing burger, the spotted pig is def worth checking out.",1

It looks as incredible in person as it does in photos- the bun has perfect chargrill lines, the patty is a perfect disc. It's extremely simple- no lettuce, tomato, or onion- but it really doesn't need any other fixings besides the roquefort cheese. Add some of the shoestring fries (which are delicious and crispy and garlic-y), and you will seriously consider going for a second round. My only qualm is the price- $20? Seriously? It's delicious, but it doesn't even come with a mesclun salad or something- just a ginormous heap of the shoestring fries. Even if the ingredients are costly, $20 is a bit much for a burger, even if it is one of the best in the city. Burger fiends should certainly try it at least once, but there are comparable ones out there for less. Also, the deviled eggs are delicious- since there's only two, I would suggest saving your server a trip to the kitchen and just ordering your own instead of attempting to split a plate because you're probably going to consider ordering more.",1

25482,1814,4.0,1,2012-05-09,"Went to The Spotted Pig last night to celebrate the bf's new job.  We had to wait about an hour for a table (got seated around 8:30 on a Tuesday night), but they took our number and called us when the table was ready so we could go have a drink around the corner. The downstairs is a bit crowded, as in, you'd better pee before you're seated or else you're going to have to move your table to get up crowded, but it's dark and just loud enough to have a buzz in the air without prohibiting conversation.  Upstairs, where I went to the bathroom because I didn't realize there was one downstairs, was a little roomier and a little brighter. We shared the buffalo burrata as an app, and while it might have been one of the smallest things I've eaten for $17, it was AMAZING.  Creamy, salty cheese, sweet roasted peppers, and some salty, buttery toast.  One of the best cheeses I've ever had.  I had the gnudi as my meal, and it was a good size for me, though I am not one for huge portions.  It was SO DELICIOUS.  I love brown butter sauce, and this did not disappoint.  The gnudi were salty and creamy and unique.  There might've been six or seven of them, and though I wasn't stuffed when I was done, having shared an app I was satisfied, and I definitely wouldn't have wanted more of them, as they were very rich. My bf had the deviled eggs, which he loved and said were a steal for $4.  He got the burger, which he said was outstanding, and I shared some of his shoestring fries (thyme and chips of toasted garlic mixed into the crispy, salty ).  The only thing he didn't like was the cheese on the burger.  I don't know if he didn't see that Roquefort was listed on the menu, or if he didn't know what kind of cheese it was, but it was pretty gross (not the restaurant's fault, of course).  So, if you've never had it, it is very much akin to gorgonzola, which I think tastes like dirty feet smell.  If you do like that kind of cheese, though, and I know there are people who do, it will probably add to the burger.  Otherwise, ask for no cheese (or maybe substitute something else) because it was hard to scrape off, and it did keep him from eating a few bites where he couldn't get it out of the meat.  He said the meat was seasoned exceptionally well and it was one of the top 5 burgers he's ever had.  *It can take really long if you order the burger medium well or well (as I learned by observing my neighbors), so if you like your meat cooked longer, order it as soon as you can and make sure to get an app or two. The desserts by themselves were nothing super special, but by combining the two of ours, we made something awesome.  He got the flourless chocolate cake (kind of like a very dense, room temp mousse) and I got the hazelnut ice cream.  Putting a bit of each on one spoon created a flavor akin to those little Belgian seashell-shaped chocolates - heavenly! Attentive service, good, reasonable beer 't mind a wait, definitely check it out!",1

20681,1814,4.0,1,2012-05-03,"On a sunny Saturday afternoon, the wait at The Spotted Pig was about an hour for a party of 5. This was expected as they don't take reservations. Inside, we were greeted with a bustling but warm and casual atmosphere. The entire restaurant has a nice West Village/English pub vibe with its modest wooden decor. All sorts of pig-themed pictures and paintings are strewn across the walls just in case you've forgotten where you've wandered into. We started out with two orders of the chicken liver toast. I'll note that it's almost become a ritual for me to start out my meals here with this dish. The bread is toasted ever so slightly that the outside crust is crunchy, yet the inside is still a bit chewy. Then a heaping pile of rich and creamy chicken liver is spread on top. Visible chunks of liver also add another layer of bursting flavor to the dish. Absolutely delicious. I've been loyal to the burger the last four times at The Spotted Pig. And being one of my favorite burgers in the city, it was quite the predicament to go with something else, but I felt like I needed to venture out and try the rest of the menu. The deep fried poached eggs with chorizo stew caught my eye as an interesting dish when I looked over the menu for alternatives. A colorful plate of expertly fried (and) poached eggs sat on top of a chorizo stew made my Saturday afternoon even brighter. Sunny yellow yolk poured out of the eggs as I cut into them, adding even more color to the dish. The eggs complimented the salty, sugary, and vinegary stew well while the savory chorizo provided that extra hint of spiciness to bring all the flavors of the dish together. Almost every table around us ordered at least one burger and ours was no exception. Each juicy patty was cooked perfectly to requested temperature and came with a gigantic pile of salted shoestring fries on the side. The roquefort cheese added an entirely new twist to the typical burger flavor, in a good way. Combined with a perfectly toasted brioche bun, everything worked together so well that almost no words were uttered during the consumption of the burgers.  Only the sound of chewing and the occasional gulp broke the happy silence. If that weren't enough, I'm pretty sure their shoestring fries were fried with fresh rosemary and garlic to give them such addicting flavor and aroma. The Spotted Pig is not only a solid choice for dinner, but also for brunch. Great food and great ambiance easily make this a favorite spot for any occasion. I highly recommend the burger and will be back soon to fill the void that was created in my stomach by not getting it this time around. Cheers! ",1

Anyway, the food was brilliant.  So rich and delicious that I felt like I was eating something very, very naughty.  Apparently (according to our server) the Spotted Pig is known for its gnudi so we started with that.  It was THE BEST EVER.  So creamy and flavorful.  I ordered the sea bass and my fiance ordered the pork belly.  We both loved our dishes.  The sea bass was really great.  The skin was very crispy and the meat was super tender and juicy.  From the taste of it, the pork belly was great, too.  I kind of wish I had tried the burger, because I saw a lot of people ordering it and it looked massive and pretty delicious.  Maybe next , the rhubarb tart, which was nice.  I did sort of wish it didn't have nuts in it, but to each his own.

The bread, though, was exquisite - rarely do you get burgers with bread that are this well grilled and hold up to a thick juicy patty like this one. The shoestring fries were delicious, filled with rosemary and garlic chips. Yummy! You also get a big mountain of them. The drinks were A-OK, although the waiter was not too helpful when I asked how ginger-y one of the drinks was (all he could say was that there was more hibiscus in the mix of the punch than ).

Obviously I did not want to wait, so what did I do? make a call in and order my burger to go!   The location of Spotted Pig is in West Village. A gastropub next door to many local residents. Since I didn't dine inside, I did not get a chance to experience the atmosphere only the burger. Roquefort Burger description- Medium rare burger, the texture was springy and moist. This was a very smooth tasting burger. However, this was only determined by eating parts of the burger not covered in the Roquefort cheese. The cheese overpowered the mild beef. The seasoning was appropriate to the mild flavors of the beef. The savory blend was applied as the patty cooked, and and it served to round out the mild flavors of the carefully constructed burger. Need I say more? ""Satisfied"" Will I be back? YES!!!",1

Don't let the wait get to you if you are hungry like me. Luckily, I arrived about fifteen minutes before opening, and right before the line started getting long. Ordered the top favs (according to yelp!) -Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring fries -Chicken Liver Toast -Deviled Eggs Burger is juicy and tender! But I really loved the ! Chicken Liver Toast was pretty good, and I'm not a big fan of liver! Deviled eggs were pretty good, but probably won't recommend it unless you were a big egg lover or something, haha.

The feast continued with Oysters, and the Fried Duck Egg.  Oysters were great.  Fried Duck Egg was highlighted by some delicious ramps.  Oh, and we even got the Ricotta Gnudi, which were like cheese dumplings.  Cari loved them, I am not as big of a ""cheese"" person.  But they tasted great with my wine. So anyway at this point, our entrees arrived.  Cari got the Black Bass and loved it.  I got the Pork Cheeks.  I was honestly so full from all of our plates!  I had them the next day, and The Spotted Pig made me happy again! I should mention that we each started with a cocktail.  I ordered the Sorrel Punch with Rum, and Cari got the Seventh Heaven.  I ""won.""  Definitely start with one of these puppies.

We put our name down, was told it was going to be a 90 minute wait and thus went to run some errands in Soho.  We came back one hour later and 30 minutes after that our table was ready.  We were led upstairs to a table near the bar with a great view of all the action.   My friends and I split orders of the Devils on Horeseback, deviled eggs,a  pot o' pickles and the crispy pig's ear salad to start.  The Devils on Horseback are bacon-wrapped dates, a great mix of salty and sweet (…). The eggs were creamy and light.  The pickled vegetables were great, especially with our entree (…).  The pig's ear was tender with a nice, crispy coating that remained crunchy even though the salad was dressed (…).  It paired well with the salad of arugula and parsley.  Of all our starters, this was definitely my favorite. For our entrees we all chose the burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries (…).  Over half the plate was filled with those ultra thin and super crispy fries sprinkled throughout with rosemary.  The fries were good, but oversalted.  The burger was outstanding.  It is served plain, with no vegetables, garnishes or condiments, as it didn't need any.  I saw that there were only bottles of ketchup at the service station, presumably for the fries.  The burger was thick and juicy and a perfect medium rare.  The bun was firm enough to hold up until the last bite without breaking apart or becoming a soggy mess.  The cheese, melted on top of the patty, had just enough tangy flavor to wave hello without taking over the lively convesation going on within the bun; the beef was clearly the star.  This was truly one of the best hamburgers I've ever had, and I don't make that statement lightly.  The pickled vegetables served as a nice break from the richness of the meat.  A pint of the local Bronx Brewery pale ale was the perfect beverage to round out this meal. All of the seats are stools.  I think this discourages people from hanging around too long, which is fine by me and all the other people waiting patiently for one of their coveted tables. Heh.  They don't take reservations so if you want to avoid a long wait come really early or really late.  It's really dark inside and the noise level is really high, but not in a bad way.  The vibe is pretty mellow and seems like the perfect spot for meeting up with friends and having a great time over a pint or two.  I love the pig-themed decor throughout.   The Spotted Pig clearly respects the pig (and the cow) and allows their very fresh ingredients to shine.",1

The food is  heavy, most of it is ""hello cholesterol"" type of the dishes, as everyone noticed  is very  pricey, but never failed to be authentic and tasty. The atmosphere of the place authentic, spontaneous and ""like in the old times"" tavern-ish, and that combined with the good food, nice lively atmosphere, cool music and the crowd I always wanted to talk to, I surely  think it deserves 5 stars for making it big by starting it simple.

I would have opted for a milder cheese, but it didn't take anything away from the meal. And I have to briefly rave about the bun. With big restaurant burgers, I often find it difficult to get through the bun without lots of frustration -- I usually end up employing a knife. However, this bun was perfect. The burger came with a heaping side of shoestring potatoes. It was quite the pile, and our whole group ended up picking away at it.

31236,1814,5.0,1,2012-03-08,"Finally! I had always wanted to eat at The Spotted Pig, but timing or fear of being let down had kept me , brothers, and my husband, and I think that we were all truly blown away. I was expecting it to be sub-par; I simply didn't believe that a restaurant could live up to all the hype that surrounds The Spotted Pig, but it really, really did. We had the crispy pigs ears, which were everything I expected; light, airy, and perfectly crisp, followed by pig cheeks and devils on horseback (which I have since recreated at home and want to go back to try at the restaurant again), which were both full of flavor and unique. We carried on with the famous burger stuffed with bleu cheese and served with a more than generous helping of shoestring fries, along with the ricotta gnudi, which I had never had before and am now a devout fan of; pillowy pasta stuffed with fresh herbs and creamy ricotta cheese? Yes, thank you very much. We actually ordered seconds of the gnudi, it was so delicious. We also had one of their seasonal salads, which was perfect as a light side to all of the other heavy dishes. The draft beers were great, as was the wine selection. Our server was a little on the arrogant side, but I was so happy with the food that it didn't bother me in the least. I can't wait for Ms. Bloomfield's cookbook to come out next month so that I can try some more of her recipes for myself!",1

Thing is this - It's a popular place, so always crowded. Not to the point where u can't move around, but still. The ambiance is nice - not too loud, not too packed, but the service is WACK. it's like they know they're cool and are gonna get business so they don't really bother. Got seated by someone that looked they came out of The Color Purple. She wasn't very friendly that's for sure. The food was good, but again let's face it, we all eat all the time, so good food isn't THAT hard to find - esp in NYC. Most of the time, it's the service, ambiance and company. I didn't get the burger/fries, which i saw people eating. I want to come back and try that. I bet it's delish. But otherwise, I don't care much for this over hyped place. There was even some D-list celebrity there.",0

I took my friend here for his birthday, and it was not a good experience. First, the place was ridiculously crowded, and we ended up being seated at this low table by a column with coat hooks, so basically I spent the entire night with other people's parkas in my face. I get that the place has a hip vibe, but pretentiously so, I feel. Like, you just wanted to yell out, ""Okay, we get it, you're all so awesome. Now, can some get me my gin and tonic?!"" Once seated,  I ordered a deviled egg, since everyone on here raved about it. It was so vinegary that I actually started coughing at the table and had to excuse myself to the bathroom so as not to disturb people. Then I ordered a salad special - Pork Rind with something and something. I thought that the pork rinds would be somehow more special than the kind you get in a bag at the 7-11, but they were not. And worse, they had a thin vinegary dressing that reminded me of the damn deviled egg! The only thing that saved the evening was the burger, which was good, but nothing to write home about. It was good. But after all the rest of it, I just wanted to go home. Bad ",0

We found a place in the bar and ordered beers and the Deviled Eggs. They were divine, covered in vinegar and chive-y goodness. I could have eaten 8 (They come in a pair) We were seated about 30 minutes later which was a nice surprise. We were seated upstairs which was bigger than i expected in a cozy corner. After stalking (reading) what to order on Yelp, I of course -had to try the Chicken Liver on Toast. I was also impressed. It was the perfect portion for 2 people (could have shared w/one more) rich, salty- a real ""treat"". My husband and I both ordered the burgers which were AMAZING and huge. Cooked perfectly and probably the best burgers we've had. Perfect, crispy shoestring fries - stacked haphazardly all around the burger. Come here - even if the wait is crazy!!! It is worth it.",1

Devils on Horseback -bacon wrapped around prunes wrapped around pears- fantastically surprisingly delicious! Haddock Chowder, so creamy, so bacony, so awesome. Roasted Pork Belly, again, great.  The top is roasted to resemble a pork rind, a little fatty, as expected, but perfectly cooked.  Covered in broccoli rabe over a base of some of my fave, polenta.  Great great dish.   And the burger.  What else needs to be said.  It has been raved about.  Called possibly the best burger in town.  All is true. The decor is just as awesome as the food.  The space is extremely old, as one can tell by the exposed brick arches, but that works extremely well.  It is quite cozy in there so get in early or prepare to wait.  But I could see the food being worth the wait. Empire Cream Ale on tap is a perfect complement to just about everything they serve.  A top beer anywhere for that matter.

11745,1814,5.0,1,2012-02-22,"The Spotted Pig has 998 reviews. I bow my head reverently, and take my humble place as reviewer #999. Clearly, I am not covering much new ground here. However, Spotted Pig *is* one of my favorite restaurants in the West Village, and is one of many reasons that I truly enjoy living in this neighborhood. The Spotted Pig has an amazing ambiance as you enter the old brick townhouse. Always warm, always cozy, always buzzing with + wait for :30pm on a Sunday night. But no matter! The most successful approach that I've had is to manage my expectations. If I have a large lunch, I don't mind eating at 10pm. If I make this one place the majority of my Saturday night, I can spend an hour drinking French Chardonnay at the bar. So then if the table is available after only 20 minutes of waiting..? Hooray! Plan ahead, and you'll do just fine. On to the food. I had no idea what a ""devil-on-horseback"" was, so we ordered some. They are bacon-wrapped dates, and they are seriously tasty little morsels. Savory, sweet, salty, scrumptious. We usually get a side of greens, which are always cooked perfectly, and usually with cheese, bacon, etc.., some sort of fat in it to offset the healthy-factor. I almost always get the ricotta gnudi with sage/brown butter, just because I love those little round pillows of cheese so much. I never get the burger because I don't like roquefort, but my boyfriend can vouch for its quality. It also comes with a heaping pile of shoestring fries, which I have tried, and they are consistently good. For brunch, I have tried the grilled cheese with onion marmalade. Now maybe it was because it was my first brunch back in the US after being in Japan for 2 weeks, eating fish, vegetables, and forgetting about cheese (well as much as possible), but thisssss sandwichhhhh was HEAVY. It sat on my stomach like a brick. Just know that before 't feel shy about saving half for later.",1

125939,1814,5.0,1,2012-02-20,"I'm giving this place a 5 solely based on the burger.   It is a beautifully cooked moist patty toped with melted Roquefort cheese, in between a grilled bun that holds up so well to the meaty fatty drippings without getting soggy.  It was the perfect bun to patty ratio, and completely made me forget the usual toppings (lettuce, tomatos, pickles, etc) that I prefer with my burgers.  Oh and the huge pile of addicting shoestring fries - the rosemary was a brilliant addition! I want my fries with rosemary all the time now!   I did try some other menu items such as the deviled eggs and chicken liver toast. Both were good but nothing notable.  The beers were pricey but large, and my stout perfectly balanced the greasy meal.  The only issue I had with the place is the cramped dining room and long wait, but that definitely will not deter me from coming back for the burgers!",1

9587,1814,4.0,1,2012-02-18,"I had a much different idea of what this place was going to be considering I had heard such rave reviews from friends. My date and I got there and we were told it'd be a two-hour wait. ARE YOU KIDDING? But me, being a seasoned-pro eating at Minetta Tavern a fair amount, knew that this simply wasn't true. We walked to Art Bar to have a drink and got a call about an hour later, which was exactly what I predicted. I don't remember the name of the appetizer we got, but it was a special - buffalo mozzarella with bruschetta and roasted red peppers. The components were really excellent - exceptional cheese, quite honestly - but one little piece of toast? Come on. I'd like to be able to eat all the components together instead of eating globs of cheese and peppers alone. I ordered the pork belly, my date got the burger. The pork belly was delicious (duh) as were the sides it came with. I love it when the pork belly sticks to my teeth - it's like little treats for later! The burger was pretty good, too. I don't really like blue cheese at all whatsoever, but it complimented the burger well. The bun was sweet and the flavors blended well all together in my mouth. I would probably get a different cheese if I ever go back and order the burger. I was truly surprised when I ate the burger because people have told me it was their favorite/the best. Minetta kicks its ass any day, sorry Spotted Pig. Also, one star knocked off because I really did not like the atmosphere there. That was the part that I mentioned earlier - it not being what I expected. It was decorated well but I felt pretty crammed. ALSO, I DON'T WANT TO SIT ON A FUCKING BAR STOOL ALL NIGHT. I'd really like to sit in a chair with a back while I enjoy my meal. If I wanted to eat on a bar stool, I'd not have waited an hour and I'd have sat at the bar. Sorry, but that really irked me. Overall, it was great food, nice decor, annoying atmosphere. I'd go back one more time to try something else and say I did it.",1

Yum!  I had the Duck, which was on special, but if it's your first time here go for the Burger. Not only is it the most affordable thing on the menu ($17), but they sure make sure you get your moneys worth. The burger is perfect, and the Roquefort cheese makes it , wine and specialty cocktails. I love how they serve SF 21st Amendment beer, so cool. The menu is as eclectic as the decor, which I feel ties into the theme of everything nicely. The decor feels very hipster yet old New York. A huge amount of taxidermy, dark prohibition feel to the entire place. Loved it. I think this place is owned by the same people who opened Breslin? Not sure.

So many good dishes to choose , burger and fries, chicken liver toast,  kale and bacon, deviled eggs, gnudi. Do yourself a favor and order one of the classic cocktails. It may be off putting for some people to order a cocktail that isn't made with vodka or tequila and loaded with simple syrup or other sweet fillers. No no. Here you will find gin and whiskey in your drink most likely based on the old school goodies. I recommend the Lion's Tail and El Presidente.

The tiny space that is overflowing with quaint trinkets you'd find in tucked away in a Notting Hill somewhere.

The chicken liver toast is simply outrageous and indulgent.  The liver is richer and fattier than most.  The deviled egg is awesome - one egg cut in half topped generously with chives, salt and somethin' spicy! The burger is, well, just plain amazing.. love the beef, love cave aged Roquefort, love the toasted bun and shoestrings.  The gnudi is great, and while a buttery, creamy, and cheesy delight, is pretty one dimensional (save for the crispy sage which really gets me going), but sometimes I kinda dig that. Amazing rotating beer selection on draught and 2 casks, as well as killer cocktails.  And the staff is just plain awesome - they make you feel loved and at home.   It's always crowded, so stop in during the week on an off-hour.  I like sitting at the upstairs bar - it can get tight but with some patience a seat or two can be found.",1

My favorite was the delicious chicken liver toast, but the deviled eggs, I have to say I've had better.  And while the burger was fine, it basically just tasted like pure fat, which I can imagine, some people would love.

The prices are a bit high for ""pub"" food, but the tastes and flavors are worth it.  The shoestring fries were maybe my favorite part of the meal.  Ambiance is fun-- walls and decorations are fiilled with character. Pigs hanging from the ceiling, in frames, and decorating the mantles.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the West Village!",1

Cheers and happy eats!",0

There was a 40 minute wait but we were willing to wait aka my friend was willing to wait and I was going to faint. So I gave them my phone number and they said they'll give us a ring when our table is ready.  We decided to go kill some time at a wine bar we passed by (see my review on Turks and Frogs). They finally called. FYI: They aren't exaggerating when they say that it is a 40 minute wait. The place is filled with so much character. Everywhere you look, you'll see something  that's related to pigs. On to the food Snack- Chicken Liver Toast- WHAT IN HEAVENS DID THEY PUT IN THIS?!?!?!  It was the best I've ever had and I've had my share of pate. YOU NEED TO GET THIS. If you don't want to wait to dine in, GET IT TO GO. I'm serious. Plate- Seared Mackerel w/ creme friache & mint- It was perfect. Very light, so it doesn't fill us up before our entrees. Entrees- 1-Hampshire Pork Belly- Ironically this was their only pork plate (…). I was expecting to go full-on swine here. Guess not. The dish was good but so was every other pork belly dish I've had. Bar Boulud is still my place to go if I was in the mood for pork belly 2-Pan Roasted Skate- (…) My friend said she liked it a lot but thought it was a bit too salty from the capers. Dessert- Banofee Pie (…) It was delicious, it was too sweet and the banana didn't overpower the dessert. Whenever I get something that has banana in it, all I can taste is banana. Not in this case though. You were able to enjoy the caramel, banana, dark chocolate, cream flavors all in one bite. Oh and by the ://­KDQPZmdQ?select=1FU7xCkKPjNOGa2YTVao0Q",1

Not much in between with people when your establishment has expectations up the pooper and a Michelin Star that nobody seems to think is legit. So I came, about 5 years later than I should have, with expectations curbed. With moderation in mind. The wait was lengthy (1 hour on the dot, just as they told me on arrival), though it was enjoyed thoroughly across the street at Orient Express.  When I saw the famous backless stools (really, they are tiny), I sympathized just a smidge with people who actually care about things like that. And , what WHAT!? We had the 2 most iconic dishes on the menu. The beautiful, bloody burger with Roquefort and shoestring fries was just as good as advertised. But the real champion at this gastro pub is without fail, THE GNUDI. As in, this is a 5 star dish. As in, this was the best thing I've tasted in at least a year. As in, you might cry while you're eating it, swim in a mixture of cheese, butter and tears, then maybe cry some more later when they are gone. That alone, plus the fantastic cocktail and beer selection will keep this place in the regular rotation for a long time.",1

Because there's soooo much to walk around and see a few streets down to keep you occupied :). Lots of great window shopping in West Village. We were seated upstairs - where the setting is really chill. Nothing fancy. Imagine a clean pub with lots of images and little statues of pigs and animals everywhere. Our waiter was SUPER nice and attentive. A+ just for him (wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out on yelp). Eventhough tthe menu was limited at this time, everything was super delicious, in particular the following: 1) Bleu Cheese Burger (super simple, but super juicy and flavorful! If you love bleu cheese, it's a must that you get this!) 2) Liver pate (yuuuum! flavored so well - balsalmic perhaps)? 3) Bloody Mary (uber fresh and delicious!) I'd definitely come back!",1
68945,1814,4.0,1,2012-01-07,"This was one of the top restaurants we wanted to try in NY.  I wasn't disappointed. Food: Of course we got the damn burger.  It was delicious and juicy.  It just comes with meat and roquefort cheese, no condiments to speak of, so I was dubious about its greatness, but the flavor of the meat won me over.  The shoestring fries were 't have ranch dressing.  I am a ranch-on-fries girl, not a ketchup-on-fries girl.  We also shared the puff pastry with prosciutto/ricotta/arugala.  That was also great. Service: The people who work here are cool.  So cool that I had a high school flashback and wanted to be like them and dress like them!  I want to work at this place and be their friends!  Seriously.  They're that cool. My one major complaint was the wait.  We got there right when they open at 12:00 and were seated immediately and ordered quickly, but didn't get our food until 1:15!!!  Luckily we were with a friend, so the wait wasn't unbearable because we were chatting, but over an hour for food, good Lord, were they killing the cow back there?",1

We ordered the olives, deviled eggs, and rolled mops and everything was delicious. However, our entrees were terribly disappointing. Everything was way too salty, my husband ordered their signature burger. He is normally a huge fan of Roquefort but this burger was so salty, he had to scraped off the Roquefort and it was still not edible. The fries were good though. I ordered the sea bass and it was completely raw (I couldn't even cut it with my knife) and the sides (cauliflower and hazelnut - who can mess that up?) were way to salty. I sent the dish back and asked if I could get it removed from the check but the waitress told me that I had no choice and I had to have it because the kitchen already started preparing it. All in all, the appetizers/bar snacks and fries were good but it certainly wasn't worth a 3 hour wait. The food was so salty, I was dehydrated until the next day even though I barely ate the food! If I could, I would give them less than 1 star based on our experience.",0

29558,1814,1.0,1,2012-01-03,"This was my first and last visit to The Spotted Pig. I went yesterday for lunch.  My 3 friends arrived before me by about 15 minutes and even though they were allowed to put their name down, they were not 'considered' for a table until we all arrived.  Whatever that means.  Anyway, the hostess reasoned that because she told the table before us 1.5 hours for a wait and there was a table sitting open big enough for the 5 of us, our wait would only be 30 minutes.  Fuzzy logic aside, we were seated a bit before the full 30 minutes and were met by our server who explained that 2 items were sold out (it was only 1pm and there were only about 6 items on the menu).  He also explained that the burgers would take about an hour to cook.  I'm not sure on what planet it takes an hour to prepare a burger especially for a restaurant with a maximum of 20 small tables. So we all placed our order and had some beers (a decent beer and wine list, I'll give place that).  Then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally all the burgers arrived.  Apparently, medium and medium rare temperatures equates to more or less raw and the hour it took to cook the burgers was not enough to make them hot or even warm.  Not good.  The taste of the burgers was a 5/10.  The cheese was overpowering and there was no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything to go on the burger.  Only one person at our table ordered something other than a burger- a salad.  It took even longer than the burgers to receive the salad which was unacceptable considering they had an hour to toss some greens together with goat cheese and dressing. Overall I'd say The Spotted Pig was overhyped and the service was poor.  You can find a better burger easily at hundreds of other restaurants throughout the city without an hour wait to be seated and an hour wait for your food.",0
125947,1814,1.0,1,2012-01-01,What a dissapointment. Upon arrival we were told a good hour wait. Then the kitchen delayed its opening. We waited much longer than an hour !!  Finally we got a table. A table that had been empty the entire time we waited which doesn't make any sense as to why we had to wait all that time. When we ordered they forgot our starters and delivered cold entres.  And the wait from ordering til the entres arrived was nearly an hour. What a complete disappointment. This is my 4th visit to this restaurant. Each time it has gone further down hill service wise. This will be my last visit.,0

I don't know how it took me this long to eat here but I really want to come back and try a few other dishes  Anyone have any recommendations?.",1
125948,1814,4.0,1,2011-12-27,"I've heard stories about people waiting outside for two hours, so my friend and I showed up at 5:15 on a Sunday evening. At that point there were already four couples ahead of us, and by the time our name was written in on the list, another two had shown up behind us. We were there early enough that there was still standing room at the bar, so we drank while we waited. The kitchen opened a little after 5:30 and we were seated at 5:50. By that time there was a somewhat constant stream of people coming in and putting there name on the list -- so showing up very early seemed to be the way to go. For drinks we stuck with the cocktails and thought they were top notch. For appetizers we split the dates stuffed with pears wrapped in bacon, deviled eggs and chicken liver toast. All were excellent, but the dates were incredible -- they just melted in my mouth and the sweet flavor with the hint of pear was amazing. For entrees we got the burger and pork belly. While both were good, compared to the appetizers they were kinda ordinary. Dessert was their homemade ice cream with popcorn -- nothing special -- and flourless chocolate cake -- not exactly unique, but exceptionally rich. Prices were very reasonable, even by NYC standards. Atmosphere: I found it to be cozy without being too loud. It helps that the bar area isn't too large -- most people waiting for a table either go outside or somewhere else. Final thought on wait time: We paid our bill and left around 7:50, and the table next to us which was seated at the same time left around 7:35. So if the first seating is around 5:45, and the second seating starts around 7:45, if you show up between 7:00 and 8:00 you're probably in for a very long wait. Final verdict: Because of the mythic wait times I had pretty high expectations which weren't quite met, but I'd go again. And next time, I'll probably order a bunch of appetizers and just split an entree.",1

Pluses: quality ingredients, served hot, good service, relaxed atmosphere Minuses: busy no matter what time you get there, food pacing is a little off and it is pretty tight seating with no back support. Even though it did take a while for our entrees to come out, they were so good all was forgiven with the first bite.",1

The place was super packed and there was a constant stream of people coming in and leaving disappointed after finding out how long the wait is for a table. They don't take reservations, walk-in basis only. Although frequented by many celebs (Jay Z is a co-owner apparently), this place was amazingly very laid back. We ended up getting seated next to THE Charlie Rose (lol). My friend and I couldn't figure out which news show he was from until I Googled it a few hours later.   We ordered the Crispy Pig Skin Salad as an appetizer and I wasn't all that impressed. It was basically Pork Rinds on top of a bed of greens. Nothing spectacular. My friend got the Burger with Shoe String Fries and he loved it. The fries were fried with Rosemary and Garlic and it was honestly, the best fries I have ever had (so far). I ordered the Steak with Roasted Spinach & B, it was still way above good. The only thing that annoyed me was that it took forever to get our entrees. The appetizer came out right away but we had to wait a good 20 mins afterwards before our entrees were served. For dessert, we ordered the Pop Corn Ice Cream and the Banoffee Pie. The ice cream was so-so (basically pop corn flavored ice cream with caramel popcorn sprinkled on top). The Banoffee Pie however, was a fluffy, sweet slice of heaven. Service was , we never felt like they were trying to rush us out despite the hordes of waiting patrons at the bar. They start serving dinner at 5:30 pm so the next time I come back, it's gonna be one REALLY early dinner for me.",1
47746,1814,3.0,1,2011-12-20,"The 3 stars here is totally and completely for the burger that I had. It was delicious -- flavorful and juicy and the cheese was all you needed (and I like to pile on the onions, bbq sauce, bacon the works!).  I thought the shoestring fries were annoying -- they're too thin! How can you eat them? Frustrating. I came here for a midweek early dinner with my friend so there wasn't a wait, as the second floor was nearly empty.  Still the hostess, who looked completely lost and not that happy to have to be seating us, put us at a table that was flush up against another person -- because these are backless stools, one of us pretty literally would have been butt-rubbing up against another patron, and the other one would be hanging out in the crossway. There were *three* open tables nearby that would have given us our own space and we asked for one of those, and the hostess obliged so we thought that was fine. HOWEVER I don't know if they were having some sort of holiday party upstairs or something but the table we ended up getting was right where at least a dozen people were constantly passing through which was hugely distracting, and the bathroom was on the other side where the hand dryer was so loud we could hear it through the door. They also would dump the dirty dishes into a tub or something also right by us that crashed very loudly when they did. I don't usually nitpick about this kind of stuff and am a pretty gracious reviewer, but I was really unhappy about not being able to concentrate on my friend, especially since she was treating me to dinner for my birthday. At times what I think were staff were just hanging out around us doing nothing which also was distracting and didn't make for a nice dining experience. Basically I think the least that a restaurant can do is having gracious waitstaff that treat you well and some people who worked here (the hostess, the people hanging around) didn't seem to give a damn.  I will say, however, that our waiter was very sweet, and a woman said happy birthday to me as I left.  Maybe all of this would have been less noticeable had we not come at a relatively calm hour (I think we ate around 5pm), but I was really disappointed.",0

The restaurant usually doesnt seat parties larger than 6, so that fact that they made arrangements for us was nice. Between the 7 of us, we covered a lot of the menu. The chicken liver toasts are incredible. Make sure to add those to your order. 3 of the 7 ordered the Dutch Baby which impressed on looks alone! Imagine a dinner plate sized crepe filled with crispy bacon and smothered in a maple glaze. According to my friends, it tasted even better than it looked. The table also loved the deviled eggs. I liked them but wouldnt insist on reordering them again. The only slight downside to the brunch was our service. It was a little slow. That being said, we sat at our table for about 2 hours and never once felt pressured to leave. I can't wait to try this place for dinner.",1

I had the burger with the string fries and chicken liver toast. The burger was the biggest mama jamma burger I've had in my life. It was big, juicy and the gruyere cheese packed a punch. it was so pungent but combined with the burger, it brings out the flavor of the meat. The shoe string fries were good but to me, they were like a throw away. The burger was big enough to fill you up. The chicken liver toast was so smooth and silky. Almost like cream cheese and it complemented well with the toast. I never liked taste of liver but after eating this, I think I made my peace with it. Saw this couple rather something else besides the burger. It was like 24 dollar salad.Kind of looked like rabbit food to me.",1

One more thing was the service - the host lady was really obnoxious, and felt like she did not want us to sit. The waiters had this attitude as if doing you a favor. Maybe cause it was just a busy lunch (maybe because of them) I expected much more. I would honestly choose five napkins (3 stars) or shake shack (~4 stars) over this place.

The AMAZING -Chicken Liver Toast - we had read amazing reviews of this so we had to try it.  Despite our skepticism, this was a unanimous favorite of the night.  It had a chicken salad texture rather than the paste I was expecting.  Served on toast, we just couldn't get enough! -Ricotta Gnuddi with Brown Butter and Sage - so freakin' good.  I've never had gnuddi so I have nothing to compare it to, which might be a good thing (for the other restaurants I mean).  Pillows of hot, soft, rich ricotta pan fried ever so gently with buttery love and served in a creamy butter sage white sauce, they were delectable! -Wild Striped Bass with Cauliflower and Hazelnuts - the fish was cooked to perfection and the cauliflower puree with hazelnuts were the perfect additions. -Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort - EVERYONE in the restaurant  (and on Yelp!) ordered the burger so we had to try it.  You have to LOVE bleu cheese, because the roquefort is STRONG.  Personally it disgusts me, but my friend really enjoyed it.  The shoestring fries were prepared with roasted slivers of garlic and thyme and were just delicious.  Even after we pronounced we were full, we just kept eating them. The OK -Duck Rillette - spread on toast, this was very interesting.  It tasted like pureed pot pie to me, and had a sweetness to it.  I can't say if I liked it or not, it was just interesting. -Buffalo Buratta with Kale Pesto and Prosciutto - this was ok but not a stand out.   -Deviled Eggs - these were just ok.  Beware, they're super vinegar-y if you don't like that sort of thing.",1

Birthday gathering? check. Catching up with close peeps? well, you get the picture. However, they don't take resies so be prepared to wait and I'd suggest taking a large crew elsewhere. Food is great too! The Burger (everyone else has already commented) is great with the shoestring fries (a major food +1 - heaping piles of tasty fries).

The Cubano sandwich is the best Cubano I've ever had and one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The bread despite looking like it would be overly chewy and too tough for a cubano is perfectly crunchy and maintains integrity throughout the meal.

That being said, here goes: Service:   how awesome is it when you go to restaurant and have such a naturally friendly and warm host? This guy was awesome, despite the packed house of hungry Halloween revelers, and me, with my ever-changing number of guests.  That was the stand out of the night. I do not have that kind of patience, so kudos to you, awesome host(s).  And of course our server was superb, too. Helpful, insightful and thorough. Oh, friendly, too. Food: Awesome. I know, I know. Everyone talks about the burger, everyone talks about the gnudi. Whatever. Both were fantastic.  I'm happily jumping right on that band wagon. And, as a girl who is sort of ""meh"" at the whole idea of shoestring fries in ? Well done, Spotted Pig.

68983,1814,4.0,1,2011-11-20,"Friday afternoon, around 1:30, the wait is only 20ish minutes. A stroll around the neighborhood, a necklace and pair of rain boots at Marc Jacobs later and it's already time to be seated. We're lead upstairs, into a little alcove of a room for no more than eight people. Our server is warm and friendly, as is everyone that helps him out. We order various teas and coffees so extra hands were necessary to swoop them all in at the same time. We shared a salad of sunchokes, sunflower seeds, escarole and a goat cheese (I think?). It was a normal plate but we decided on it for an appetizer and woah, it got us very excited for whatever was to come. Not only had we never tried sunchokes before, adding to the excitement, but the salad as a whole  was like none other. There was a lemony dressing with the cheese so soft and getting into ever delicious bite. My main might just be the best hamburger and fries I've ever had. How could I not order that after all of the hoopla I've heard? Arriving on a shiny grilled bun along with a whole haystack of shoestring fries, I knew I was in for something good. I'm still mesmerized by those fries! Deep-fried rosemary leaves are strewn throughout them, as well as slivers of garlic. Cut so thin, the fries were like potato chips- the best chips I've ever had. The burger tasted like a burger should taste- here's the beef! I ordered it medium rare and I could really taste the meat that was moist to the point that I don't know how it stayed together. Roquefort cheese took it over the edge. Not ketchup for this baby, but I added some mustard. This would be a five star review if not for the fact I feel I have to account the table's experience as well. My sister is a vegetarian and ordered the pumpkin soup. Like any other item on the menu, a list of ingredients follows the titles. She was home free; she said this was the best soup she'd ever tasted! But then she encountered a cube of pancetta and after finding this out, she had to send it away. Word to the veggies, ask questions! I still loved the atmosphere, loved the food and loved the time I had here. The Spotted Pig, new location in Toronto perhaps?",1
9639,1814,3.0,1,2011-11-19,"The first time I came, I ordered the burger, which was delicious.  I happen to love Roquefort, so that didn't bother me.  I love how the meat stayed pink.  There were a lot of fries though.  The second time I came, with a larger group, I ordered the ""special"" - pork cheeks.  I was slightly disappointed.  It just wasn't that good and was served on a piece of bread, which I thought was weird.  I don't know, maybe I'm just not used to eating pork with tomatoes.",0

They sat us upstairs at around 9:10 and we were cramped(originally a reservation for 3, 1 came later) but were served water right away.  They had a good selection of beers including a popular SF IPA. WARNING: We ate like pigs family style so i'll break the review down into categories: Bar Snacks: Marinated Olives-Meh,not my favorite. Deviled Eggs-Great, nice balance. Chicken Liver Toast-absolutely the best thing we had all night, we all agreed and ordered 2 orders.  It's basically a Pate with a more course texture.  Tons of flavor. Roll Maps-interesting taste but very good. Plates: Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart with Marjoram-  Very fluffy pastry, nice-filling.  I wish I had more prosciutto though. Rabbit(forgot the name of the dish).  Very heavy, tasted like rabbit drowned in lard.  My least favorite of the night. Buratta Cheese- This was great, could have ordered another one of these. Entrees: 3 of us ordered the burgers.  They were very good but the cheese was too salty.  We all were in agreement.  The rosemary shoestring fries were addicting though. Pork Belly-Loaded with fat and grease.  A little too heavy and too much fat for our taste.  Flavorful too. Desserts: Flourless Chocolate Cake-Heavy but pretty good. Creme Caramel-The better of the 2 desserts. Good balance, perfect palate cleanser. Overall, we really liked the place but we ate WAAAY too much.  My wife can't eat anything off the menu, well maybe the deviled eggs so I won't be returning with her but when some good buddies want to check it out, i'll definitely return.  Service was good too, the only downfall was that the place was every packed and small but hey, this is NYC.",1

Delicious spread pate.  Also had the bone marrow which was pretty good but seeing others get the deviled eggs and devils on horseback made me wish I changed my decision.  The 've reached the ceiling!  Unbelievable!  The prime meat with roquefort cheese with charred bun was terrific.

The atmosphere is adores-- reds and pinks like your Mama's country kitchen in South Cackalacka. Here's where The Pig loses , I went into septic shock. He was literally the worst person I have ever met. Then there was this chick with a bedazzled banana clip who descended upon my friend's seat like a starved, rabid raccoon. It wasn't her poor manners that offended us as much as her decision to look like a reject from a Pat Benatar cover band. I yelled at her, ""Franke says relax!"" I strongly feel this place is a bit touristy or a lighthouse beacon for boys who hate their mothers and girls who think blue eyeshadow is OK even though Oprah told us TEN years ago that it wasn't. I give this place three stars for decor and having Six Point IPA on tap. And the fact that they can't control the trolls they attract.

The hostess was friendly and allowed me to find a place at the bar (which was easy on a Tuesday night.) I asked the bartender for a glass of red wine, and she plunked down a white wine glass. I asked for a red wine glass, and unfortunately i got a lot of attitude in response. I was told that I had been given the correct glass, but maybe they could find a bigger glass if I insisted. I was floored, and I replied that I would demur to their standards, but that I was confused that I was getting a white wine glass for a red wine. The bartender snapped that ""I know what a wine glass is"" and then slammed down a red-wine glass. Great, so I got the right glass. The wine was $13. OK, so for a $13 glass of wine, i would expect the correct glass without getting the attitude. The crowd was also kinda corporate and douchy.  So, not really worth the time and trouble.",0

The burger was just ok,  but the fries were some of the best fries I have ever had. They were so light and yummy with little  bits of fried rosemary throughout.

We got the soup, the burger and the deviled eggs. My boyfriend and I devoured the burger and ate up all of the shoestring fries - very yummy. The cheese is a little strong so it might not be to your taste. I think the eggs are not that special so you can pass on those if you know what a deviled egg tastes like. The corn soup was as mentioned before extremely good. Overall - this place was very good, but the wait not so much.",1

Our menu included: Spicy Mozzarella with marinated olives and toast - yum! Whole Roast Suckling Pig - good but I prefer a crispier skin (Filipino style if yaknowaddamean) Duck fat fried potatoes - OMG good! but soooo bad Flourless (not flavorless) Chocolate Cake - super rich I'm glad we went with the private dining option, because the wait for this place on a Friday night was about an hour and 45 minutes.",1

If you're not claustrophobic, this place is well worth patronizing. It's pricey, definitely a splurge in my opinion, but the portions are perfect and the food is masterfully prepared and presented beautifully. The pumpkin soup with pancetta is to die for, seriously. I also had the prosciutto and ricotta tart with marjoram, the prosciutto was nice and soft- this was such a delicious and well balanced dish. it was savory, creamy, and the tart was pillowy and flaky. The grilled skirt steak was just OK- i found it bland, and for the price the portion was far too small. There literally was just enough steak to fill a taco with. Not cool. The sauteed spinach was good, but it wasn't enough to save the steak. I should have known better than to order something so simple after seeing so many good plates on my way to my table. The seared arctic char with cauliflower and hazelnuts was amazing. Well worth the price and a great compliment to the pumpkin soup. Tender, savory, and moist. YUM.",1

We expressed our dissatisfaction with our fish preparation, as it didn't meet our expectation based on menu description (most of our entree was cartilage, not fish). The waiter was not accommodating or apologetic in any way. We furthermore expressed our dissatisfaction to the host on the way out, and were quickly dismissed.

8817,1814,3.0,1,2011-10-13,"The gastropub concept took off in London a decade ago where pub patrons have long lamented the lack of good food to accompany their mugs of hearty ale. New York has finally caught on in recent years but Spotted Pig is the undeniable pioneer. Spotted Pig has been open since 2004 and yet on a Friday night throngs of hungry and thirsty New Yorkers still descend upon this West Village spot. The 100-seat restaurant has kept its no reservations policy so be prepared for a wait. On busy nights that can be an hour at the least.   Chef April Bloomfield came recommended by Jamie Oliver and her simple yet memorably delicious dishes does not disappoint. Since you most likely would have downed two alcoholic beverages by the time you get seated start with the chicken liver toast. It's a savory sweet combination that will both satisfy and rev up your appetite. Then have the Pig's twist on a British classic, Devils on Horseback. Bloomfield's version has them soaking the prunes in tea and stuffed with pickled pear before it is wrapped in bacon and cooked with a dash of cayenne. Yes, it is make your mouth water kind of delicious. Also a must try is the gnudi. The ricotta dumplings are rich with butter, Parmesan, and sage but still light in texture. For more substantial entrees there is the burger with Roquefort cheese, steak, and the squid if you want something a little more different. The dishes leaned towards salty but if you think about it, these dishes are essentially bar food and what better way to encourage drinking than salty food. There's a good selection of both beer and wine but the seasonal cocktails are also good to try. For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is satisfyingly rich and the seasonal fruit tarts are excellent. On a recent visit it was a peach tart topped with an exquisite lemon verbena ice cream. Now, while the meal was quite enjoyable there is an argument to be made that it is also overpriced. Put simply, it is dressed up bar fare, simple dishes that are executed well. So whether or not your tab at the end of the night is justifiable, especially with the hour long wait, is a question left up to each diner.",0
125965,1814,3.0,1,2011-10-13,"Tucked away on a quiet corner, it's easy to walk right by the Spotted Pig without noticing it - if not for the fact that it's packed to the rafters every night.  My friend arrived an hour before me, so I didn't have to wait long, but I did hear them say something about a 90 minute wait to people who came in after us. We went all out on the menu since we didn't want to waste the long wait.  Not sure why, but somehow I started off with a devil theme: Devils on Horsebacks (bacon wrapped pears and apples cubes), and Satan's Whiskers (smooth and fruity gin drink).  I would've picked a beer off their solid beer list (2 cask aged ales), but just wasn't in the mood that night.  The bacon wrapped fruits was surprisingly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad because you can't screw up with bacon wrapped anything, but it didn't blow your mind like a bacon wrapped thingy should. To balance out the forces of evil, we grabbed some sheep milk ricotta gnudi (heh, nude).  I thought this was fantastic.  The ricotta cheese balls are so strong in cheese flavor, you can't help but pop your eyes out a bit. For entrees, I ordered an arctic char with cauliflower, and my friend grabbed the special of the night, slow cooked pork loin.  My fish was perfectly cooked throughout, had a crisp skin, and a creamy white sauce with little chunks of cauliflower swimming around in it.  I loved it. We couldn't sing the same praise about the pork loin though.  The server warned him that it'd be a la carte, but seeing how it was the special, and how it was priced similarly as the other entrees, he picked it.  It came out as a plate of sliced pork.  Most of it was pretty dry and tough, and it sat in a salty broth.  It would've been fantastic as a leftover pork sandwich (picture coleslaw and salty pork on a rye roll), but incredibly disappointing for a place called the ""Spotted Pig"". It's good food, but with other options near by, I'd have to pass next time.  They might've had an off day with the pork, but if you do visit, I'd recommend a non-pig dish at the Spotted Pig.",0

125966,1814,4.0,1,2011-10-13,"I had a really hard time deciding whether to give this place three or four stars. My whole entire reasoning for going was to have this famous burger that everyone talks about. As it turns out, it was my least favorite part of the entire meal. They don't take reservations but I got there at 7pm on a Wednesday night and was greeted with a 90 minute wait. Luckily my friend just came up with the idea to stalk the bar and wait for people to get up and leave. We did just that and were sitting within 20 minutes. The atmosphere is pretty cool but you can tell this is a place everyone goes to after work. Onto the food, we ordered the Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped prune with stuffed poached pear) and Chicken Liver Toast. The Devils had to be one of the greatest appetizers/snacks I've ever had. The first words that came out of my mouth were ""this makes so much sense"" and it absolutely did. I understand the concept of sweet and salty, but never did I think a prune, pear, and bacon would mix. It's brilliant. I don't even like pears and I couldn't stop eating them. The chicken liver toast was pretty interesting, but I guess the texture kinda creeped me out a bit. The flavor is there but I wouldn't necessarily order it again. We got two burgers to split between three people and the first thing you notice are the amount of shoestring fries. The fries were perfect and seasoned with garlic and herbs. The burger itself was cooked very well and was very juicy, but it's the cheese that kills it. The roquefort is just too strong to have on top of a burger. I litterally just ate every part that didn't contain cheese. And the smell is not very good either. For dessert we ordered the Popcorn Ice Cream and the Bonaffee pie. I'm not a big fan of popcorn to begin with but it's definitely worth a try if you're into obscure flavored ice cream. The pie, however, was insane. It contains thin and even layers of bananas and dulce de leche with little dollops of whipped cream on top and chocolate shavings. Very much reminded me of the Bananas-in-a-Box from China Grill (my favorite dessert in NYC), so I was INSANELY happy when I had my first bite. If it weren't for the Devils on Horseback and the incredible pie, I would have gone for three stars. Worth going back to check out other dishes, however.",1

I do remember some major disappointments, though: - the food was too salty.  all of it.  not in a, this-is-tasty-at-the-moment-but-I'll-be-thirsty-­later sort of way, but just unpleasantly salty.   - the food was over-priced.  all of it. as a stand-out example, a side of pickles was $6 (in my memory -- it might even have been $7).  it consisted of a few wan carrot sticks along with some other items, doused in salt and vinegar (and again, not in a good way).   - the space was way too crowded.  If you're paying $6 to eat pickles (and a lot more to actually eat your meal), it would be nice if inebriated people from the bar would not be practically falling over your table. I had a nice dinner but that was entirely a function of the company I was with, and almost nothing to do with the restaurant itself.  Based on my experience there, I have to wonder whether part of the positive reception of this restaurant is just response to hype.  There was recently an economics study performed where they demonstrated that people actually enjoy a bottle of wine more if it's priced higher than if the same bottle of wine is priced lower -- maybe that 'wishful thinking' effect is in operation here?",0

69041,1814,4.0,1,2011-10-02,"Very cozy (read: tiny) place in the West Village, but it sure does have its charm.  We started off with a couple of cocktails as we waited to be seated at a table - on a Wednesday night there was about a 30 minute wait at 7pm, not too ridiculous considering the size of the place.   Our table was in the back corner in a booth, which was so very close to the next table over, the occupants of which we presumed were on a first or second date as we were close enough to listen to their conversation (a little too close for my taste, but that's New York for you). Tried the chicken liver toast as a friend (and all of Yelp) suggested.  I can do pate/foie gras/etc no problem, and I live by the mantra to try anything once so the word 'liver' didn't scare me. I enjoyed this appetizer, yes, but I don't think I'm well versed enough in the tastes of such fare to consider it as mindblowing as other ' thang then I would go for it. And then came the burger. Ahhh the burger. So thick and juicy, with some Roquefort (could have done with more, for sure) and a nice cold Speckled Hen (an ale that foams like a Guinness! wowza)... perfection.  I'm sooo glad I made sure to come here while I visited NYC!",1

We eventually decided to try our luck at the bar upstairs because we were told we could order food there. Elbow to elbow with not that many seats/tables. So we ended up having to eat our burgers standing up. The bus boys had to put our food on a stool, on the bar, and some people had to hold their plates (massively inconvenient). We were here primarily because we'd heard great things abut the burgers. The chargrilled burger was good and came with a ridiculous amount of shoestring fries. They put way too much roquefort cheese on it (enough to be overpowering), but other than that, it was a good burger. Maybe not $18 good. On the plus side, the bartender was great. She was very understanding of letting us split the bill in strange ways.",0

After a 1.5 hr wait that turned out to be a 2 hr wait (to while away the hours, walk half a block west to Orient Express, where they make excellent cocktails), we got seated at an awkward table upstairs. My companion and I had to sit side-by-side against the wall facing other diners, with him trying to balance on the seam of the sofa. The pickles were inedibly salty. The stracciatella cheese appetizer was also doused in salt; the squash it was served over was saturated with a sharp vinegar that anesthetized our tastebuds for the duration of the dinner. The roquefort burger was meaningless; the meat insipid and the roquefort overpowering. The crispy skin on the pork belly was the consistency of shoe leather, (we brought it home, where our dog thoroughly enjoyed gnawing on it.) The shoestring fries got cold in about 30 seconds as they tend to do, having no substance at all. The waiter sneered ""no"" when I asked for mayonnaise (apparently, they don't ""do"" mayonnaise - like it's some kind of specialty fetish.) We couldn't ask for the check fast enough. This is the worst example of a restaurant hype gone bad. They're clearly serving more folks than they can cook for.

The hostess was very friendly and took our cell phone number so that we could go get a beer somewhere while we waited as their bar was full. There was another bar about 100 feet from there. We were sat at a table upstairs. The tables are tiny bistro tables with white table cloths and butcher paper. The decor is super cute with a farm house feel. The waitress was attentive and friendly. We decided to order the deviled eggs for an appetizer. They are really delicious, the filling is the creamiest filling I have ever had in a deviled egg. One appetizer is two halfs of an egg.

Then got to chatting with the friendly bartender. Very nice and sociable, we talked about where he was from, I informed him I'm on vacation, and he actually gave me a few other bars to stop by.

26181,1814,4.0,1,2011-08-25,"I'm pretty sure the interior of The Spotted Pig is exactly how I want my brownstone to look when I become rich and insane. Each bar stool is upholstered in different, yet eclectic fabric patterns while still maintaining their masculinity. Quirky frame after quirky frame adorn the walls in an organized chaos, an exhibit all its own that requires multiple viewings as if this were a modern art museum. Even a trip upstairs to the second floor seems to wring character out of the gutted home in which The Spotted Pig now resides with its every inch being put to good, New York-cramped use. And then, if this were truly my domain, I'd invite my mother over and wait for her to faint while she gasps at the intentional color-miscoordination and claustrophobia-inducing visual overload, when she can finally convince herself that her son is a full-blown hippie. Now, I am pretty far from being any sort of hippie, but being under thirty, living in New York City, and seeing nothing wrong with having two different types of chairs at the same table - to my mother, I'm a hippie. But I didn't come here to discover new ways to scare my mother half to death. I came here for the burger. Of course. And their Char-grilled Burger ($17) is an exceptional block of meat, soft, flavorful and juicy, luxuriously complimented by the melted roquefort cheese. Now, if you like roquefort, look no further, this is your burger. If you could go with something a little less sharp and a little less stinky given the choice (The Spotted Pig does not give you this choice), their highly-touted burger in its current form will by no means turn you off, but it may fall a bit short of the perfect patty your taste-buds had in mind. Now, as I fall into this latter category, I don't know if this speaks more to my general intrigue regarding the rest of the menu (Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi! Lamb Crepinette! Something called Roll Mops!*) or if the burger, despite being fantastic, suffers from a ridiculously high level of hype it was doomed to live up to. The shoestring fries that come with it are matchstick-thin, crispy, and probably fried in the fat of a Fatosaurus Rex or something because only the fat of some extinct, possibly entirely made-up animal could produce a taste this delicious. I wouldn't argue with the man who came here for the burger and returned for the fries. As for me? I'm coming back for both. *OK, the Roll Mops are pickled herrings. I'm no longer intrigued by this one.",1
22103,1814,4.0,1,2011-08-24,"Heard this was a great place for a brew and a burger, so me and a few buddies decided to hit up the place. Its a very small British pub type of environment with low lighting, so it gets very crowded and cramped to seat in. Also, you can't make reservations which sucks if it gets too packed and you have to wait for an hour, especially on an empty stomach. But, its nice to kill time at the bar and try out some of their nice selections of beer. Their signature drinks are probably the cask beers, but note that these are served relatively warm, which may be unusual for beer drinks like myself. The Spotted Pig Ale was pretty good, but the other Cask option, the Six Point IPA, tasted like dirt. After getting seated, we decided to order the bar snacks as appetizers, such as the Chicken Liver Toast and Deviled Egg. The Chicken Liver Toast was very good and provided a good amount of chicken liver on each slice. The Deviled Egg was very average, although I personally like it since I'm an egg lover, the rest of the table found it mediocre and nothing special. We also ordered the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, which was pretty damn good as well, and was incredibly cheesy and flavorful, making it a highly recommended starter as well. Finally, the entire table ordered the Spotted Pig's Signature Roquefort Goat Cheese burger with Shoestring fries. As a fan of goat cheese, I definitely loved the burger, however it was a bit overwhelming on the burger which make it really salty. The burger itself was pretty juicy, although i should have ordered it medium instead of medium rare since it was more bloody than medium rare should be, so lesson learned. If ketchup is needed on a burger, its never a good sign. However, the fried was the redeeming part of the dish, and they give you a lot of fries with each order, and the fries was pretty good on its own without any ketchup or salt. Overall, it was a quite a good experience, and I would recommend trying it out once if you want a unique beer and burger experience. 4 out of 5!",1

Their menu features innovative twists on English pub classics, so be sure to order the to-die-for Roquefort burger (which comes with killer shoestring fries), sheep's milk ricotta gnundi, and their rabbit with braised peas (!) - I can definitely say it was the single best rabbit I've ever eaten in my life (inclusive of my trip to Tuscany). Mind you, popularity comes with a cost. With a no reservations-policy and the fact that The Pig's one hundred seats are always filled, the wait can be brutal. The process of getting a table can be quite frustrating, but the dining experience is definitely worth it. Just sit back at the bar and enjoy the piggy décor as you down an Old Speckled Hen brew as you wait.",1
38817,1814,4.0,1,2011-08-14,"I've been dying to try this place for so long and have frequently stared at the menu debating what entrees I should try depending if I ended up there for brunch or dinner. I finally was able to come in this past Saturday for brunch when a friend called me up asking to catch up.  I told her there may be an hour wait but she was game. We agreed to meet up at 1pm however, due to the jacked up subway lines on the weekend, I was 30 minutes late. As soon as I stepped off the subway, I ran towards Spotted Pig where I saw my friend waiting at the corner.  I asked if she already put her name down on the list but said she didn't. Oh well as we walked in and spoke with the hostess who told us luckily, the wait would be 10 minutes after writing my name down.  However, she decided there was actually a table upstairs and a gentleman led us up immediately.  PERFECT. Spotted Pig reminded me of those Old British pubs.  They didn't have mahagany paneling but dark magenta walls lined with tasteful British knick-knacks. I inadvertently made a comment stating, ""That's our table?"" when I saw a rather cramped looking round table against a booth and the gentleman quickly asked if this table was ok. My friend said it was fine as we were seated next to each other rather face to face. We immediately received our menus and had 2-3 different waiters attend to us. One taking our orders for our drinks and another one coming by later to ask about our order.  My friend really wanted pork but  didn't see any on the menu since it was still brunch. Our waiter sensed something was  amiss and quickly told us there were specials and both of our eyes lit up.  He first talked about the ground up pig's face wrapped up and served with duck's egg and lima beans.  There was a second special but that went out our ears. Both my friend and I chose that dish along with unsweetened ice tea and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The fresh squeeze orange juice was $5 and was served in an 8oz glass which was rather disappointing since I saw my friend's iced tea served with sugarcubes for $3 and in a much larger serving of 18oz (give or take). Our plates came and were surprised it didn't come with toast or some type of bread to soak up the duck egg.  I immediately sliced into the pork and the richness was not as overwhelming as I expected.  It was light and went down easy settling well whereas other pork dishes I've had settled uneasily for me. The duck egg was definitely different and I can't put my finger on how to describe the taste of the yolk but let's just say, I wanted to try it again to have  a better feel of the taste. Our waitstaff was very attentive with 2 -3 different men checking to make sure we had enough water and asked about our food. Overall, our brunch experience went very well despite so many stories of the long wait time.  I would definitely come back and try the dinner menu!",1

30492,1814,3.0,1,2011-08-11,"Dang, I read an article in the New Yorker about the chef who opened this restaurant, and I was prepared to be delighted and sated. Alack, The Spotted Pig offered me only the latter, which isn't a bad thing, I just expected more. Apparently you're supposed to order the burger here. Do order it, especially if you like SALT. The roquefort cheese has a SALTY finish, and the frites are generously coated with SALT. I had to scrape the cheese off my burger about halfway through eating it, but even that wasn't enough. I then had to cut my burger in half, horizontally, and eat it open-faced. The meat was fine. That roquefort wasn't very pleasant, only because the frites just made it worse. Fortunately the cask beer was very tasty and it was the only thing I could wash it all down with (needless to say it took several pints). For an appetizer, I had the pot of pickles, which was lovely. I wish I had saved a few to fight the SALT battle I was waging against this ""famous"" burger. Go to Island Burger in Hell's Kitchen if you want a good burger. No, you won't see famous people there, but you'll enjoy your meal a whole lot more, I promise. The wait staff , but also with it. My friend and I came at 1pm on a Tuesday and the place was barely over half capacity, yet it took her far too long to refill our drinks. She simply forgot. That's not acceptable in my book. After my friend and I left in a pouring rain, we headed for the White Horse Tavern down the block. As we sat at the bar stools, we were flagged down by an employee of The Spotted Pig, who had run out of the restaurant into the rain to search for us. My friend had left her shopping bag at our table! That was a nice touch, and sort of made up for the inattentive waitress. All said, the decor was nice, some of the food was okay, I can see how this kind of food is supposed to be ""good,"" but it was far too SALTY for me.",0

62478,1814,2.0,1,2011-08-07,"Service was just okay. I had the mussels as I saw others with them. Never have I received such tiny mussels that were COLD and coated in mayo. Never mind that many were served closed, too. We received a slice of toast with it but what was the point? There was no broth to be found. Shared the pig's ear salad. I love all things fatty, sweet, etc. It was so salty and so fattening that we could barely stomach it. Barely any greens. What a sad disappointment. I think that my bacon craze might be over. Yes, it was really that awful. When we mentioned the cold mussels to two waitstaff, they shrugged and said nothing. No one even bothered to check on us while we were eating, either, so after waiting over an hour, of course we were hungry and we ate what we could. This place has really gone downhill since the days that it first opened; I remember sitting next to ""Diddy"" and Jay Z. Funny how I didn't see them here, or anyone else of importance, either. Not that it matters, but still, what a difference! Someone told me, ""just get the burger and fries,"" but I'm sorry, there must be better burgers to be found in this city. I would not wait an hour on a Sunday for that! And so, I bid adieu, to you Spotted Pig, as I'm relieved that I will never have to wait in your over-hyped, non-ac'd establishment again. If the service was not average, this place would not even warrant a two star. Don't waste your time--and better yet--don't read Urban Spoon, where this place is still a winner!",0

The Gnudi was very good but not out of this world and the Roquefort burger is completely overrated. Overall, after the windup and hour wait and for the money I was disappointed.

17870,1814,1.0,1,2011-08-03,"The first time I came here to the Spotted Pig was on a Friday evening with the boys. We had the turkey liver toast and the Roquefort burger with the shoestring fries. After being very confident about the meal here I brought a girl here on a Saturday morning. What a mistake - We waited for nearly an hour as it seemed like people who came in after us kept on cutting us in line and the staff was rude this time around. After having the amazing chicken liver toast and burger the first time, I thought it'd be natural to have the same. I don't know what changed in a span of 2 weeks but the chicken liver was absolute rank and smelled and tasted awful, the toast was burnt to a crisp. When I mentioned this to the waiter I was met with a disgusted look like the waitress had better things to do with his time and she firmly told me that's the way it's prepared and that's how it's always been. I informed her I had been there two weeks ago and it was great the first time. Then came our burgers, which I always order medium-rare, This burger was charred to a crisp, I could not believe how bad it was, that I refused to eat it. Once again, I spoke with the waitress and she claimed that I had ordered a Well-Done burger. Now that was just BS, my date and I were furious and I looked completely like a fool for recommending this establishment in the first place. To add insult to injury, the waitress seemed like she just wanted to keep the flow of people going. Honestly, I don't know how they would stay in business if this is how they treat customers and why would anyone want to come back.",0
125981,1814,3.0,1,2011-07-31,"Wednesday dinner and there weren't many available spots but then Dan squeezed us in upstairs but left us with a mildly surly, yet competent, waitress. Dan was really cool in that he was honest about his opinion(s) on the different menu items including the beer list. I started with the house bitter cask ale which was, actually, quite good. I wish I could've brought home that barrel of it in my luggage but, apparently, there's some type of weight limit on how much you can check onto an airplane. Needless to say, there I am at JFK trying to figure out how to effectively get the ale out of the damn thing so I can at least enjoy a pint or seven before I had to leave it behind. No dice on that. I ended up leaving it in some bushes near the AA terminal. I hope it's still there when I go back. The devils on horseback were recommended by everyone and their mother, and even some of the panhandling guys on the train were asking, ""Spare Devils on Horseback?"" instead of ""Spare Change?"" I enjoyed them but, then again, it includes bacon. Bacon even makes spoiled milk taste better. Not impressed with their famous burger. I can't really place it. It just didn't rub me the right way. The Roquefort cheese was on the side (which I tried but didn't like) so that wasn't it. However the shoestrings with the rosemary were pretty good. Dessert was essentially a baklava with dark chocolate and a light cream. It was okay. I recommend sharing it with someone so if you don't like it, you can pretend to be a gentleman by not stuffing it all in your mouth like I did with the Roll Mops (pickled herring rolls). I should've ordered many more of those. Atmosphere was yupstery which, at no extra charge, included the unspoken fashion and accessory show that goes on at places like this. Don't get me wrong, my ensemble included a maroon velour pullover sweater with the collar intentionally popped but not all the way up because I had to maintain my I'm-so-cool-that-I-don't-give-a-fuck-how-my-­collar-looks look. I also pushed the sleeves halfway up my forearms and left part of my button-up shirt, that was underneath the sweater, untucked so I could offer the crowd a peek at my studded belt. Helpful tip: Although not for everyone, I highly recommend the Roll Mops as one of the appetizers/tapas plate which'll leave you asking, ""Spare Roll Mops?"" to complete strangers when you get on the train later that night.",0

20580,1814,4.0,1,2011-07-29,"Great atmosphere, but it really does get overcrowded especially if you're not a bar type of person and you're here just for the food. The wait wasn't bad though, the host said that it'd be half an hour but we were seated within 15 minutes. Awesome service. I don't suggest bringing more than 5 people though, the tables are really small, and there's a lot of side-to-side seating but they're willing to accommodate however you want to sit. I personally liked the side-to-side seating, it was like the perfect date atmosphere. The place was nice and dim and the music wasn't too loud either. So my friend and I started off with the pot of pickles and the chicken liver toast. It was the butteriest, smoothest, almost pate-like liver I'd ever had. It was awesome, it reminded me of Vietnamese pate I'd have in sandwiches. I thought the pot of pickles was going to literally just be pickled cucumber but it was a medley of veggies like string beans, turnips, and gerkins, and carrots. That was really fun to eat but I really wished I had saved it for when the burger came out. And of course, we had to try the famous roquefort cheese burger and shoestring fries. It really didn't disappoint. Each and every one looked like the pictures. It was big, but not too big. Huge mound of shoestring fries with fresh rosemary and fried garlic strips in it. I just didn't like the fact that it got greasier and we went through the fries. I would have preferred for it to be a bit thicker but that's just me. The fact that I was trying to be polite and not shove handfuls of fries in my mouth took away from the full experience that I could have had. Oh well, it was good. I took heed from other yelpers and ordered it medium-well and of course, I was given a medium-rare burger. Best decision of the night. Amazing texture in the meat. I'm not a fan of really strong cheeses and the first scoopful of cheese I had on the burger frightened me but when I bit into the burger, it just all made sense. It's no wonder they don't let you choose your own cheese. It really meshed beautifully. However, if you really don't like super sharp cheeses, you should scrap off some of the excess. Amazing burger/bun, no complaint. However, my partner felt as thought a pickle would have been nice (I knew I should of saved that pot of pickles till the end) but I think the sharpness of the cheese was enough oomph for me. I thought it was perfect. My friend ordered the lamb special. It was 2 morel mushrooms stuffed with lamb, I believe, but I think it was very disappointing. I wanted him to order gnudi but he was being ""spontaneous"" (he was being silly passing up house-made gnudi) and ordered 35 dollar mushrooms equaling the size of my fist. The flavors, although interesting were way too bold to be eaten alone. I felt as though it needed another carb or a side of vegetables other than beans. And I can really sense the saltiness that other yelpers talked about in this dish. Way too much going on in that dish. I'd have sticked with the much talked about gnudi. Bill came out to almost 80 bucks including tip (speaking of which, service was really good. It's a bunch of down to earth young people that work there.) Overall, nice joint, a bit overpriced but it is a damn good burger. Didn't have enough room for dessert (I lie, I was low on cash) but there was flourless chocolate cake that I absolutely wanted to try. It's okay though, I will definitely be coming back for the gnudi and another gorgeous burger.",1

The burger is much-maligned in that it comes one way: with roquefort cheese. For the uninitiated, Roquefort is a very nice sheeps-milk blue , I think the burger is still worth a try, but I'm not sure I'd go back for it, given the Roquefort. But what do I know (everything). Fun with a group, or intimate with a date. Have it your way (not including the burger, you can't have that your way).",1

After this delicious, rich, creamy, livery and buttery concoction hit my lips I knew there must be a God! By far the best crostini of any kind that I've ever had. For $6 I would have been happy ordering three of them to serve as my entire meal. Yet I had to control my urge and try other things on the menu. I ordered the special that day which was a grilled octopus over some sort of bean (pinto like but not pinto) and seaweed beans (a lot like green beans in flavor and texture). It was very well done. The octopus was tender and had a great grilled flavor. I wouldn't necessarily pair it with the offerings of beans and seaweed beans, the flavors worked but weren't exciting. My fiance had the burger. It was perfectly cooked, flavorful, juicy and paired amazingly with the stinky cheese that came on it. The enormous heap of shoestring potatoes that came with was enough to intimidate any mammal, not just being the human variety. My friend who was also there ordered the other special that day which was lamb with a mint sauce (chimichurri like) and jalapeno relish. The lamb was well cooked but the flavors of the lamb may have been overshadowed a bit too much with the intense flavors of the mint and jalapeno. They also did put a bit much of the sauces and extra mint leaves on the plate as well which may have contributed to the lack of lamb flavor. Overall the bill came out to about $200 with tip. We also had about $60 in beer and cocktails. We had a great meal and I would definitely be back for some more if in NYC again.",1

Anyway, I am a bit of a picky eater, and there wasn't much on the menu that I'd try, let alone pay for. I settled on a burger, and I was not disappointed. It was delicious! It took a while to come out, but the server warned us, which was nice. The Roquefort cheese on top was a nice touch - there was even a little too much of it, which is surprising, since I adore cheese. Also, the server wasn't shocked that I didn't want a bun and didn't screw up my order, like many places do when I order a burger. The fries were salty, crispy, and plentiful, so much so that I didn't finish them. I also might add that when we were seated originally, the waitress sat us side by side, which is not a good move. Luckily, they were nice enough to accomodate our request to move so that I was on the booth-ish side, with my friend on the opposite side in a chair. I saw another couple come in and get the same.

I then ordered the famous Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings and was not disappointed. The cheese was hot and melted over the patty, which was between a buttery bun and was just sensational. The bartender made me the best cranberry and club soda that I have ever 's an easy drink to make, but the proportions are almost ALWAYS off, but he was spot on. It was super refreshing.

The gastro-pub was busy, lively and nosy in a great way. The restaurant probably seats around 100, 50 street level and 50 upstairs.   The restaurant is reasonably priced, and the portions were huge. Between two, we got a handful of cocktails, pickles, chicken liver, muscles and burger. Everything was really good, especially the pickles and french fries!!! Drink wise, I loved the PG tipple. If you are a bourbon fan, you must try it. The burger comes with bleu cheese so if you aren't a fan, you should get that removed. I also love the fact that they cook the burger on the pink side. We ordered it medium well (not my choice) and it came medium to us :) The chicken liver was okay, I prefer duck liver in general though so was not mind blown. The pot of pickles though, sooo good.

So updated my Facebook Status and found my buzzed buddy Hank who was willing to meetup for a 2nd dinner. I had my driver take me from JFK straight to the ""Pig"". Met my buddy at 1AM and we started with some beers and Deviled eggs (delicious). Then we had the Gnudi (TO DIE FOR) and the burger (O EM GEE) this thing is amazing. It's on par with the best burgers of San Francisco, think NOPA, Chez Maman, and Zuni. Order this thing medium rare, and WOW, this baby just melts in your mouth with a great kick from the Roquefort Cheese. OH the fries that accompany this thing are delightful as well. Garlic, Rosemary and fried to shoestring perfection. So the food receives A's all around. The atmosphere has this quirky warmth that I love, and the crowd was entertaining and very generous in buying rounds of drinks for everyone.

This place doesn't take reservations, and there is a long wait to get in depending on what night & time you come. We came on a Sunday at 8:30 , at which point there was a one hour wait. Totally worth it. The Chicken Liver Toast was a fantastic combination of savory & sweet. The friend that I split it with and I have decided to experiment with recipes until we can make it at home- we just can't imagine our dinner parties with out it! I also had the Octopus, and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try a tentacle-themed dish for the first time. It was char-grilled, and the salad around it made spearing for the protein kind of fun. The decor of The Spotted Pig was my favorite of New York. It glowed with wild abandonment.

Before I get into the food I just want to say that we got there at 8 pm. I forget what day it was but I want to say it was a Thursday. The wait was 90 min. but you are allowed to leave your number and they'll call you when it gets close to time which I thought was pretty cool. So my friend left his number and we went somewhere else for drinks to wait it out because the place was way too packed. We went back in about 70 min. later just to be safe and we were seated upstairs within the next 10 min. So on to the food! We started with the deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, sheeps milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter & sage and the burgers for our entree. The deviled eggs were just deviled eggs, the chicken liver toast was delicious but the ricotta gnudi with that brown butter & sage was exceptional. It was hands down the winner of the night and to all you calorie conscious people out there it is worth every single calorie! Now the burgers, which we both ordered medium but mine was with cheese and his without. Both our burgers came out more medium rare than medium. We also both agreed the burgers lacked flavor and juiciness. Now I would give this place a second try on the burger but next time I will definitely do without that roquefort cheese! Boy is that a strong tasting cheese which totally over powers the otherwise under seasoned burger in my opinion. Just an fyi there are no other cheese options and no bacon either! The fries I thought to be a bit salty but they were cooked perfectly. Overall a cool place with a friendly staff but I don't know if it worth the wait but like I said before I would go back to give that burger another shot!",0

Shoe string fries - they are way too salty but cut well and come with fried rosemary and garlic tossed in. Might want to order with less salt. The potato fried in duck fat - good but not worth $8 Milk braised pork shoulder - underwhelming and is not a sharable size.  Did not come with sides so basically a braised piece of pork for $28.  It was tender though and well cooked. Skirt steak - was probably the best thing we ordered and came with just plain beats which are good no matter what. Overall a good environment to grab some snack food and a beverage if you have some money to burn and want a hip environment.

19421,1814,3.0,1,2011-07-01,"Ambiance is great, but I was expecting a little bit more from the renowned Roquefort Burger. Waiting line wasn't bad - we were seated in 25 minutes. This place fells busy but that's not bad - it's rather quiet and somewhat intimate (bring your gf here, she will be happy). All the menu looks good, and I felt a little bit sad for the chef as 90% of the people were only sampling the burger LOL. The meat was almost perfectly cooked (should have been juicier), and the Roquefort was perfectly balancing the meat and the bun. It was really good, yet not as perfect as a 5 napkins burger one. The letdown were the fries - more similar to chips - and their Spotted Pig beer, rather bland. All in all, for the price paid I was expecting a little bit more. 5 Napkins Burger set my bar pretty high (not even Ray's Hell in Arlington, VA could match it!) and so I give this place three stars only. In any case, I enjoyed the burger very much and if you are a burger aficionado don't miss the Spotted Pig!",0
8351,1814,5.0,1,2011-06-27,"I had one of my best brunches here.  My friends and I got there right as it opened on a Sunday, so had no problem getting seated.  Love the decor of this place, don't love the little stools, but I get it. I had a fried poached egg and chorizo special, with a side of hash.  My friend got the french toast.  The chorizo was so good, it had kind of a sweet BBQ-ish sauce on it, but still had some spice.  It was totally different than any other chorizo I've had, but really good.  The poached eggs were prepared perfectly within their little breaded house.  Only negative is that this dish should come with potatoes or something because with the sauce and the poached eggs there ends up being a lot of liquid on the plate, and I felt like I could have used something to soak it up.  The hash had a great flavor, and I loved that too.   For dessert, we split a handmade donut with chocolate filling.  The filling was cold which surprised both of us, and the donut had a lot of lemon flavor happening.  Not my favorite dessert. The unlimited coffee was really good, and ask for cream, it's really legit, looks like it just came out of the cow, cream.",1

125991,1814,5.0,1,2011-06-25,"I would like to consider myself a connoisseur of the hamburger.  I can enjoy them on so many levels.  I enjoy the simplicity of the McDonald's hamburger, or basque in the triumph of a well executed burger-spectacular.   Whenever I travel I always seek out the best place to get a Hamburger.  This brings me to a fantastic place in the East Village called The Spotted Pig.  I first experienced the Spotted pig almost two years ago while visiting a friend for the weekend while I was traveling on business in Upstate New York.  I was scheduled to fly back to Los Angeles, but decided it would be a nice to see an old friend and visit the greatest City in the world.  This burger experience happened by chance.  A conversation that went something like this ""We are going to this place that a friend of a friend of a friend works 's  owned by JayZ, Bono, the Dali lama, Bill Gates and Boutros Boutros Gali.""  Not quite that exaggerated, but there was definitely a little mystery about the joint. When we got there it was PACKED!  It was during the Gay Pride parade and the surrounding streets were filled with revelers.  So we head inside and with a secret handshake we are granted access.  Now I was a little tipsy, but I do remember having the most magical burger to pass these lips.  I remember commenting that If a Unicorns existed, and it was socially acceptable to eat !  For the last two years I have not shut up about that burger, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced and could not wait to go back.  I would say I have sent no less than 5 friends and family members to eat there, and they have not been disappointed. MLK weekend 2009 was when I would return. It was Sunday around 12:30pm on the coldest day of Winter when my girlfriend and I walked in.  We were greeted and lead to our table right away by the very friendly and approachable staff.  Upon recommendation of a friend I had sent to the Spotted pig, we started with the deviled !!  Hard to place the flavor profile, but in the creamiest of fillings I believe there is some vinegar perhaps cold pressed olive oil, whatever it was was delicious.  Since it was Sunday morning it was also washed down with an expertly spiced Bloody Mary.  Then the moment I had been counting down the hours (I'll spare you the obvious joke), and it was waging War like ancient Empires for territory with a mountain of garlic fries.  Perfectly shoestring cut with the right amount of salt and some sort of chopped leafy green herb make McDonald's fries taste like cardboard.  The element that sets the fries into savory orbit, sliced garlic that is fried to crispy perfection interlaced with the fries.  Every few bites of golden fries comes a subtle crunch of a mini garlic wafer.  These fries could warm to coldest of souls on this chilly January afternoon.  Now it is time to turn to the star of the meal. The perfectly toasted bun appears to be freshly baked in-house and fluffy as a down pillow.  I pull back the bun to take a look at whats going on at the scene of the crime.  A perfectly shaped patty with a little salt and pepper and a perfectly melted dollop of Roquefort cheese.  No lettuce, no onions, no ketchup, this burger is an homage to how the simplicity of two ingredients can breed greatness.  Looking down at my burger with the top bun removed suddenly I feel something amiss.  Suddenly I am at the Louvre staring at the Mona Lisa with something missing.  Instead of her signature sfumato smile she is donning a pair of Red waxed lips, you know the kind that children hate to receive on H, and the signature smile returns. I take my first bite, and I am immersed into instant bliss.  The past two years waiting for this burger to touch my taste buds again were not wasted in vein.  I was instantly gratified knowing anyone I has sent here now owed me a favor.  The combination of savory burger/Roquefort and slightly sweet bun is a match made in culinary heaven.  The burger was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested, and the juices were soaked up by the spongy bun that would make a Shamwow jealous.  I temporarily lost track of the social obligation of conversation, and 10 minutes 47 seconds after starting I finished my burger and promptly apologized to my Girlfriend for ignoring her the entire time.  There could have been a grease fire in the kitchen that blocked my only exit from the building and I would not have addressed the situation until that burger was finished. I guess what I am saying is if you have the means, go to the Spotted Pig and get the Burger.",1

7783,1814,2.0,1,2011-06-24,"The restaurant did not deliver on its hype from other reviewers.  I'm still confused as to how our party of 5 all seem underwhelmed by the food.  We ordered the deviled eggs, devils on horseback, burger, mussels and bone marrow.  The devils on horseback was all right but I don't generally care for fruit and meat together.  Theirs is a prune stuffed with pear and wrapped in bacon.  A mushy fruit and meat bites to me, but glad I tried it.  My friend has the mussels and said they were fine but nothing great.  As for the bone marrow, it was quite disappointing for its price tag.  The bone marrow was small and unseasoned while the pea toast lacked seasoning too.  Overall, a poor dish for such a well-known place.  Lastly and most importantly, the burgers were a far cry as described by others on Yelp.  If you like blue cheese sandwiches with a  hint of meat, then this is for you.  I'm a cheese lover, but the cheese was too, too powerful for the burger.  It was pretty sad when you get just cheese and meat in between bread for $17.  On the bright side, the star of the plate was their shoestring fries flavored with garlic chips and !  Although the food was not fantastic, the space and service was excellent and warrants at least another visit.",0

But the wait doesn't stop there, do expect to wait a while for your food. While we waited we got some drinks and my rum and coke turned into a gin and coke. I ordered my drink upstairs, but had the bartender downstairs fix it and she wasn't happy about it. Not sure what kind of rum she used, but needless to say, I won't be ordering it again. After finally getting a table, we started with the deviled eggs right away.  I wasn't a huge fan. We had the lambs tongue and the gnudi and a side of fries and chicken liver toast. Chicken liver may not sound like the most appetizing thing, and it honestly didn't look too appetizing, but it was delicious! So good, tasted more like chicken and less like liver. The lambs tongue was just like the chicken liver; tastes better than it sounds and looks. I've never had lambs tongue before, so I don't have anything to base it off of, but it was pretty good. Tasted like a very tender piece of steak. The gnudi was to die for. So creamy, so cheesy, so perfect. If you don't like anything that's super cheesy, I don't recommend this. The fries didn't taste as good as they looked, but they were still so so good. I like my fries super crispy. Be sure to ask for less salt; they were still super salty. They fry pieces of garlic with the fries which just add to the flavor. We passed on the dessert and while we weren't stuffed, we were satisfied. The bill wasn't outrageous and for the amount of dishes we had, it felt like a steal. The waitress was really nice, great service, just slow with the food which was expected as there are so many people ordering and only so many cooks.

12772,1814,3.0,1,2011-06-10,"I mean, it's been on my must-go list FOREVER and let's be honest, everything that could possibly be said about this place has been so I won't waste your time (or mine). In short, I came (starving) at the perfect time--12am on a Thursday and was able to sit right away. They recommend coming before 8 or after 10 to escape the harrowing crowds that take up the corner of 11th and gren; immediate props for the homey feel of the place, checkered tablecloths and all. I highly recommend the 75 south--it is honestly the perfect summer cocktail with bombay gin, lemon, cava and the magic maker: rhubarb , you try explaining to me what the hell that is--no matter, it goes down like juice and at 12 bucks a pop it's easy to wrack up a hefty bar tab before taking a bite of anything. While I so appreciate the kitchen being open until 2am, things inevitably run out and I was EXTREMELY irked when the burgers ran out as I was in the process of ordering one--something our waitress, though very helpful up until that point could've pointed out as we'd taken our sweet time to order. Grrrrrrrr. Alas, I'll have o go back, and that's honestly alright by me as I still need to taste what is perhaps the biggest Bloomfield draw to this place. The food we did manage to score though hit mostly high notes. The chicken liver on toast was truly fabulous--no it's not incredibly unique especially at gastropubs such as this one where upscale bar food is the main event, but this one rivaled pulino's (the best in my book to date) and was the perfect starter. Also in the small plate realm were the famed devils on horseback (I was truly excited about these babies) and the beets and greens. While the former was delicious (i mean, it's bacon), i was a bit disappointed as they were practically swimming in their own 's not quite sexy to have to shake off the excess oil from these tiny meat lollies. The beets were good, nothing to write home about but it was nice that they came warm as opposed to most beet preparations. To continue, the gnudi, sharing the must-have title with AB's roquefort burger, were , or maybe, ever. The brown butter, while more-ish was a bit overwhelming. The portion is right for sharing as I don't know if one could (or should) consume every single on of these large pillows of ricotta. Mmmmm. Don't get me wrong, it's utterly sinful (especially when you dip the crunchy bread into the sauce--seriously try this) and worth a try, but lord I think I can still feel this in my stomach (thighs, ) days later. We opted for the octopus as well which had a great char to it and was perfectly cooked. It's not as memorable as 'inoteca's version but it was a nice balance to the rich pasta. Lastly, the market greens was a blah side, but a necessary dose of veg among everything else on the table. Don't try to ask for any changes or additions or substitutions though (aka, ""may i please have tomato on the salad?"" ""No."" ""Um, ok."") because you won't get em. All in all, it's definitely a gem and a great people-watching spot and I really do need to go back for that damn burger. But the ridiculously inflated prices, lack of subs, and overall 'we can get away with everything bc we're in ny feel' while fun if you buy into that for a night, has its moments. ...I would love another one of those 75 souths ",0

The waitress was nice, and was quick to inform us that almost half the menu (which was quite small to begin with) was unavailable because they ran out of the stuff. HUH!?!?!!!! these hipsters sure have no expectations! They take whatever they can get I guess. BUT when I go to restaurant I expect to be able to order what I want from the menu. Another thing I learned about hipsters is that they have no taste for food. The cheese they use for the burger is so nasty. I felt nauseaus all night. The mussels were okay The pasta special was okay very salty. Also, I tried the Spotted Pig tap beer and it was freaking WARM! Who likes a warm beer? is this another hipster thing??? It would have been okay tasting if it were chilled. but this was lukewarm. EW Totally bummed I did not like the food",0
20918,1814,4.0,1,2011-06-05,"One of my favorite gastropubs, easily.  It took me years to go but having gone a few times recently, I really do think its worth the hype, even with a few off items.  The low-key but quirky corner storefront blends right into the neighborhood, with an abundance of vines and plants, a hanging pig sign, and a plethora of pig paraphernalia on the window shelves and throughout the establishment.  There's the bar and seating on the first level, and another bar and more seating on the second.  Located inside what was probably once a house, the seating areas have a bit of the feel of a warren.  Casual decor, woods and dark green, and the ubiquitous pig theme.  Seating is fine but not the most comfortable, mostly b/c it can be a bit cramped and you're a bit close to your neighbors.  Staff are friendly and accessible. The food is earthy and generally meat-centric, and almost universally thoughtful and well-prepared.  Their famed roquefort burger was one of the few dishes that underwhelmed, primarily b/c the roquefort was simply too strong, overwhelming the entire burger.  Loved their shoestring fries, the blissfully and perfectly made duck special, which was some of the smoothest, most tender duck I ever ate, a fantastic crisped and tender corned beef hash, fresh and plump shibumi oysters, and the supremely tasty and texturally satisfying chicken liver toast.  A veal sausage special was a let down, drier and not so flavorful, although its bed of super hot polenta and tomato sauce was yummy.  My one taste of dessert was a great slice of rhubarb tart.  A great selection of beers (draft, bottled, and cask), wines, and cocktails. One reason I haven't been here sooner is being scared away by the threat of an hour plus wait no matter when I go.  I'm happy to find this is definitely not so, although some planning is probably good.  Weekday lunch and early weekend brunch turned out to be sweet spots for me.  Can't wait to go back!",1

The roquefort was pretty strong and overpowered the meat (and i like blue cheese). The fries were addicting though. Couldn't stop eating them. Thought April Bloomfield's lamb burger at the Breslin was better (and the fries there are just as good). In terms of pub burgers, I still prefer the one at Burger and Barrel. By far the highlight of the food was the chicken liver toast. She does right by toast- the parsley/anchovy and the periwinkle/morel toast at the John Dory are kick ass. And so is this one hear. A must order. Got the left-handed negroni, basically a negroni with Maker's instead of gin. Loved it. 3 stars for the burger alone. The great chicken liver toast and cocktail adds a star.",1

And as a lover of burgers, I can't deny that their Roquefort burger is amazing (and huge, and will probably send you running to the gym right after you eat it).

Chicken livers on toast.  Not my first choice, having grown up kind of having to eat them (cheap meat), but they were spot on.  So delicious and comforting.  My only complaint would be the olive oil drizzled over them, it seemed superfluous. Deviled eggs, very good, again with the olive oil all over the place but the eggs themselves were tasty. Our mains were really good.  The deep-fried poached eggs, as odd as they sound, were excellent.  I am glad that I don't live there because I'd eat them every Sunday and be as big as a house.

Finally, karma was on my side a few nights ago!! We scored a table without waiting!!!! In oddly enough the same table I sat in the last time I was here. Sorry but I can't tell you 't dare risk jinxing this. The service was friendly and the food outstanding as usual. The chicken liver toast was spot on. The burgers excellent as always (not as much cheese as usual which made me quite happy) with an almost comically massive pile of fries that must be finished no matter what. The real star of this meal though was the soft shell crab. I am a soft shell crab fiend and always insist on ordering it whenever in season. I had never seen it on the menu here before and didn't expect much but the British twist on this was divine. The crab was perfectly cooked in this luscious, almost tempura like batter. It was freaking amazing. We inhaled it and wished there had been more crab. I can't believe I am saying this but this was the best soft shell crab I have ever had. All in all a great meal. The waiter charged us for a coffee we didn't have which was pretty annoying but fixed it. There is one thing I wish would change about this 's mayo? Perhaps I should write a ",1

Before I go on my review, let me just say, what the hell are ramps - they were all over the menu. Did not try it because I don't like leeks or onions, which is what the server said they tasted like. Anyway, the general consensus is in keeping with my opinion - get the burger, get the gnudi, and for gods sake get the chicken liver toast, and definitely get the beets which were served with some sort of picked kale or other heart green, and their sweetness and crusty burnt edges made me think that perhaps I could be a vegetarian. The restaurant opens at 5 for dinner - I would say if you get there before 6 you would not have to wait. Think of it as a second lunch.

12874,1814,2.0,1,2011-05-15,"W?  Seriously?  I came here for brunch and of course it was packed, but I was excited after hearing so much about this place.  First thing I noticed when we ordered, the waiter didn't write anything down, and it wasn't just two of us ordering three dishes, it was four of us ordering about six dishes; but we figured, hey, clearly they've done this pretty well for quite a while, so no worries. Started with the deviled , if you've got a Michelin Star (is that right??) there should be something more than just mayo on a boiled egg.  Okay maybe it was a little more complicated than that, but not by much, and definitely not worth the $4.   Next was the bacon, pretty good, thick cut, perfectly crisp, good flavor, no complaints.   Then our main dishes came out, the burger, eggs with hash, and french toast.  The burger was good, but not great.  The cheese had a strong flavor which I liked, but something was missing, however I destroyed the mountain of fries that came with it.  Eggs with , really enjoyed it. French , we didn't order french toast?  Actually we got pancakes, and this is what happens when you don't write stuff down.  Anyway, we didn't feel like correcting the order and it's sugary just like pancakes so we ate it anyway, not bad. Well that's weird, four people, only three entrees?  Oh yeah, we also ordered the smoked salmon ?  Well anyway, that was a mistake that we did need corrected and finally got that fixed.  Again, it was good, but certainly not memorable.   So overall, I'd say a 3 star spot since only half of the dishes I would say hit.  Combine that with two mistakes that could've easily been avoided if you just wrote down what we ordered, this place drops to two stars.  Too many places in the city bring their A game every time that are cheaper and less packed than this place.  I'll probably devote my time to finding those spots instead of waiting in line here.",0

Almost rare, smeared with bleu cheese, served on a grilled brioche bun with shoestring fries, this single, simple entree that put The Spotted Pig on the map (okay, maybe Mario Batali put it on the map) earns its keep.

17908,1814,5.0,1,2011-05-09,"Clearly The Spotted Pig doesn't need another stellar review, much less a review at all, but I think it's pretty remarkable that they've managed to maintain a commitment to quality for roughly seven years and it's important to reward that, so review it is (it's the least I can do, right?!). How to describe The Spotted Pig? The food (and atmosphere too!) is luscious, rustic, hearty, earthy, and funky, all rolled into one. It's an experience in gastronomy to be sure and it's certainly not for the faint of heart. Picky eaters, vegetarians, or those watching their waist - beware! It may be tough to find something for you here. (Even most of the vegetables are cooked in some type of meat stock!). Let's start with the cocktails, Spotted Pig's only misfire. While they sound great on the menu, they are small and not fantastic, and at $12 more expensive then they should be. If you are in need of a pre-dinner cocktail, a better bet would be to saunter over to Orient Express less than a block away where the cocktails are divine. Spotted Pig's wine list is great though, with options ranging from $9-$15 and some decently priced bottles, some even at $35-$45 (my threshold). I go through phases where I don't eat animals and then someone tells me they have pig ears on the menu and my brain and body go all sorts of haywire and suddenly I need to have this pig's ear immediately (I mean, if it's good enough for my ). This particular evening, the Crispy Pig's Ear ($15) was a special appetizer and it was phenomenal. It was fried up, sliced thin, and served over bittery lettuce with bits of lemon and a little bit of salt. The balance of crispy fat, bright lettuce, salt, and citrus was remarkable and intriguing. We also ordered the oysters (6 for $18), and they were good, but basic. I'd go with something else if I had to go back (if I HAD to!). We shared the Scallops with Ramps (vegetable du jour!) and Chili ($32), which was magical, and the Veal Chops with Artichoke and Dandelion ($36) - heavenly. The Spotted Pig does not take reservations, so either get there right at 5:30 for dinner service (and then, if you're lucky, you can get the best seat in the house - the back left corner, which puts you in view of the entire room, as well as the kitchen, where you may be lucky enough to spot April Bloomfield working her magic) or put your name in and be prepared to wait (they'll call you so you don't have to hang around).  (A good place to wait ).",1

Fantastic. Just the decor was great, artfully done. Servers were cool, young hipster folk. 1. Chicken Liver Toast - OMG. CLT. Awesome 2. Beets and greens - Never been a big fan of beets, but this was my Aha moment. 3. Roquefurt Burger - Split it with the wife, and mmm it was quite good. Not quite Umami's truffle burger, but very tasty. The fries were plentiful and just a tad bit too salty, and combined with the whole burger, it would have been much more salty, but I'm not complaining. 4. Gnudi - Yes. Good. We had 2 days in NYC.

18732,1814,3.0,1,2011-05-06,"At Spotted Pig I first encountered Devils on Horseback. Cheap look, nice taste. Fries not that impressive, because when you make potatoes hair thin, they absorb at least 200% more oil than regular fries (bigger surface area). I was wondering why it is called Devils on Horseback, so I looked it up. Definition #1: A darker, cheaper version of Angels on Horseback - oysters wrapped in bacon. (I probably would call it ""Angels Undercover As Pigs"") Definition #2: Variation of ""Pigs in Blanket"" - as you can imagine, it's bacon wrapped sausages. Definition #3: Found on Squidoo. DOH stems from Cornwall in the south of England at the turn of the last millenium, where Norman raiders would disguise themselves is suits of armour made by layering rashers of bacon. First, they look grotesque and frightening, then after the job was done, they can eat their armour. Protection was roughly in the same class as leather armour depending on the thickness of the bacon. ""Devils on horseback"" was the nickname of these bacon-clad warriors. Anyway, it was just all too crowded and smoky. But I love Devils on Horseback. Wassup Jay-Z!",0

The seating arrangement is very,very tight. Literally, we a had a couple sitting right next to us less than a foot away. We ordered: -Chicken Liver toast -Roqueford cheese burgers with shoestring fries The toast was a crispy slice of sourdough bread with a hearty, savory chicken liver topping with creamy texture.

The entire time we were there the kitchen staff was running up and down the steps, loudly. Stomping I should say. In a huge hurry, frantic. Ordered some burgers, a med and two wells. The food took forever. The waitress said it was because we ordered well done burgers. Well 't take 35 minutes to cook. The med burger was raw and had to be sent back. In which case they just half ass reheated and returned my same burger to me. The fries were okay, although the sliced fried garlic chips in them were delicious. Im not a huge fan of rosemary and was a little disappointed to see the pile of fries covered in it. $55 for three burgers. I'm not sure if the calm before the storm of dinner service had everyone there in a shit mood, but the staff all seemed miserable. Also the beer list is not very interesting.

41585,1814,3.0,1,2011-04-28,"The West Village is one of those neighborhoods that's so inexplicably enchanting, that even the most manly man can't help but feel charmed by the rich architecture, European-esq streets, and affluent young couples content with their three-story walk-ups. One of the more popular eat-centric attractions in the West Village has been The Spotted Pig, a corner gastropub, which features a chipper mix of twenty or thirty-something adults, juicy hamburgers, and an inevitable twenty-five minute wait. The Spotted Pig is a staple on most people's ""must try"" list-including the plethora of European tourists that have increasingly crowded the already jam-packed name-list. Popular entrees like the Pan Seared Scallops with Ramps & Chili Pan and the Roasted Veal Chop with Baby Artichokes & Dandelion will run you $32 and $35, respectively, so the eatery is hardly as pedestrian as its interior suggests it should be. Instead, most people opt for their Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings, which is ""modestly"" priced at $17. The burger meat itself was obviously top-notch. Any order other than ""rare"" or ""medium-rare"" would be a shame. The Roquefort cheese added a tangy flare to the juicy meat, easily sovereign to a slice of cheddar. The forgotten hero in the marriage goes to the bun, which thankfully contained the thick burger with all its juices, as well as the quickly melting French-born cheese. In addition, the shoestring french fries provided a salty excursion from the main event. While the fries are shoveled from a heaping metallic vat of a bowl in the kitchen, it is pretty apparent they were (at some point) made with care. I also noticed that the fries are cooked with eloquently sliced garlic cloves, which are then deep fried with its potato counterpart. I was split on if I'd rather get a side order of the shoestrings or just the garlic slices. I eventually concluded that both together were fine. As good and fulfilling as Spotted Pig's burger was, I found myself wondering, ""Why the price tag?"" Without proper knowledge of where the beef was from-probably the reason for the eye-popping $17 price-tag-it left me with a sour taste in my mouth (which is impressive considering the amount of salt in the meal). Unfortunately, my true belief is that much of the cost goes to the fact you're actually eating in The Spotted Pig. As sheik and trendy as I felt sitting on a mangled stool, crunched into a corner of the busy restaurant, I almost wished I had just walked to Madison Square Park to indulge in yet another one of Danny Meyer's finest.",0

We waited another 10-15 minutes to be called and I tried not to panic (I hate the feeling of always being in an active walkway).  They took us upstairs and it was just as packed as the downstairs.  They showed us to our table and I noticed that most people sat on the same side of the table (I felt like I would have had to dislocate my shoulder like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon just to fit on the same side).  I requested a seat and they brought out a , a stool.  To me, nothing is worse than constantly fixing your posture because your back is able to collapse on itself.

Three words: Chicken Liver Toast Holy mother of God. This $5 dish (and one of my momma's dishes) are the foods that I'd request to eat before I die (oh, I should update my Yelp profile). And sadly, there's a side of me that wishes I never tried it, because now life is remembered and divided as Pre-Chicken Liver Toast and Post-Chicken Liver Toast. Please open a location in LA!

Although I have to say the Pimm's Cup at Highlands is much , there is a third level to this bar, that would go completely un-noticed, unless a member of a bachelor party came over to you and said ""Hey, do you want to join my friends for an open bar, private party on the third floor???""  Needless to say, we had a great time and it was awesome being in this little room, without a huge crowd, that overlooked the street.  It seems as though they had a dinner party first, where the chefs cooked in an open kitchen right in front of their tables.  Pretty cool.  And the Flourless Chocolate Cake that they had extra of was to die for :)  can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  Nice spot in the village.",1

Note: In actuality, the tables are so crammed together that you physically need to pull out the table in order for the person sitting in the booth to get 's New York without a little space issue? We ordered the chicken liver toast based on word of mouth alone and it blew my mind! I've always hated liver for its texture and taste, but this gave me a new perspective entirely. Though it looks unappetizing (brown, kind of looks like wet dog food), its taste is phenomenal. We were both shocked at how good it was. We also ordered 2 mugs of the mulled wine after we figured out what was being ladled out by the hipster bartender, which is probably my favorite winter drink of all time now. The burger, which was the original reason we went, was good but I'm not a fan of Roquefort cheese. It seemed overpowering, even for my friend who liked cheese. The meat itself, pretzel bun, and shoestring fries were great though. The overall decor of the pub is eclectic, with a definite West Villagey feel to it. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and never made us feel rushed to leave. It might have been the buzz, but we left there 3 hours later extremely satisfied and happy!",1
113128,1814,3.0,1,2011-04-11,"It's that time again, boys and girls. Time for another burger adventure with Amal. Not much new to report on The Spotted Pig, but I'll say it anyway. After sending my burger list to a buddy I hadn't seen in 6 months, he told me he wanted to come here. From where I live on the UES, it took 45 min to come here for a Sat. lunch, so this is kind of a one and done experience for me. First, the infamous wait. For a 1pm lunch, the place was packed, and we were told 40 min.  We figured it would give us plenty of time to catch up, so we CLEARLY sat at the restaurant bench outside the window. At the 40 min mark, we went in to check, and were told they called our name out the door 10 min ago. Yeah, okay. But they still gave us the very next table which we had to wait another 10 min for. We were seated along the bench by the window which had very low-set tables and stools, which is slightly awkward. Oh, and they seated us right next to a heatpipe! Blergh! Really, you set up a table next to a heatpipe?! We both came here for the burger. Their beer selection is decent, so my buddy got one (I approve since I MUST do burgers with either beer or coke), and I got a coke, which was miniscule. The burgers took over 30 to finally arrive, which was a little annoying. My first thought: good but overrated. The meat is excellent quality and was prepared medium to order, there's no doubt of that. While I do like my burgers seasoned with salt and pepper, this is one of the only ones I've had that was just TOO salty, as was the Roquefort cheese it was topped with. It was overpowering and distracting. Besides that, the burger was still good, and I loved the toasted brioche bun it was served on (probably helped soak up some of the saltiness). Also, while I don't mind lack of toppings and just enjoying the meat (yeah, I said that), as in Minetta Tavern, this burger could have helped from some. The fries, on the other hand, were great. Extremely thin-cut and topped with rosemary, some of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, my buddy and I both did note though that they are so thin and long that they are way too unwieldy. Overall, service was okay. We got our waters refilled once and the waitress checked up on us every now and then once the food (finally) arrived. Décor was pretty standard for an upscale gastro-pub, and as I mentioned, tables are kind of awkwardly low-set. I didn't get a chance to see their fancypants 2nd floor, which is supposedly the celeb haunt. Would I come back here? Given the combo of price, commute, wait, and the fact that I thought the burger was overrated, probably not. Though I am tempted to try burger at The Breslin, another restaurant by head chef, April Bloomfield, which has a slightly different burger and rumored phenomenal thrice-cooked fries.",0

Yelpers got me really hyped up about this famous burger and pulled pork, had to try it out! beer #1: Six points chocolate rye #2: Capt'n lawrence pale ale, pretty damn good as well. I'm not gonna lie, my review is almost solely because I enjoyed the beer so much (I was never much of a beer girl), and this place definitely changed my opinions of beer! By the time we were seated (SUPER cramped, and chilly because we were by the door and it was the nearly the dead of winter still), I had a serious buzz goin on. Food arrived pretty quickly and we decided to order another bottle of wine. The burger was good but, not superb. I think the crispy pork was better but then again, this was after I had 2 beers and half a bottle of wine in , but I think I'll only return for drinks; the dinner is not worth the hassle and wait.",1
9407,1814,4.0,1,2011-04-11,"I got to NYC at 12:30am and was thankful to be in the only city on the East coast where you can still get a good, sit-down dinner at that time. If you aren't opposed to a very, very late dinner then come here, because the Spotted Pig's infamous long wait for a table was nonexistent.  We were in that cozy room upstairs to the left, such a great ambiance.  The sort of communal feeling where you're nearly bumping elbow with the folks at the tables next to you, but it's so loud and vibrant in there that you feel you have plenty of privacy. Great menu, plenty to choose from.  We ordered quite a bit , but the absolute best was the liver toast, the herring, and the pork belly was just perfect.  It was the only meat I've ever had where the fat on it could be featured as a dish all its own!  Upon reading the other reviews for the Spotted Pig, I can't believe we didn't try the burger ",1

116988,1814,4.0,1,2011-04-10,"Saturday night: 7:45pm. My guy suggested The Spotted Pig. I previously had drinks here but not food and was interested in trying it out. Spotted Pig takes no reservations but there are plenty of bars to chill and have a drink while waiting for a table. There are two bars at The Spotted Pig (upstairs and downstairs) but don't bother drinking there - over-priced beverages and very crowded seating. You'll be bumped into more times than you can count. But if you're insistent on staying, then go for the upstairs bar - it's slightly mellower as most tourists don't know it exists. We chose to get drinks at a French wine bar called Rouge where the bartender will offer you free wine tastings. We put in our names around 6:45, had a drink at Rouge and were called back to The Spotted Pig by 7:45pm. We were given a table upstairs to the left of the bar in a intimate and cozy room. We had an amazing table where we sat side-by-side on a banquette with plenty of leg room. This alcove off to the left of the bar is the place to be seated - very romantic and all 6 tables had ample room. We couldn't even hear the couples on either side of us. The service was pleasant and quick. Our young (and possibly foreign?) waitress knew exactly what she was doing and was friendly and efficient. We ordered the Chicken Liver Toast (A+), their famous burger (A) and their Oxtail dish (B). The Chicken Liver Toast was the highlight. Perfectly rich on a thick slab of bread. The burger lived up to expectations and contrary to some reviews on here, ours was not too salty or overpowering in terms of the cheese. The oxtail was a solid B. The oxtail and the potato puree that came with it were delicious but I did not like the bitter greens that came on top. It's a personal preference as I'm sure some people would enjoy it but I dislike cilantro and it tasted too much like a cilantro green. I wish there was more variety to the menu but i appreciate the care that goes into the limited menu. In a city where you never have to go to the same place twice, I'm happy to return to The Spotted Pig. PS. Get your after-dinner drinks at Turks and Frogs down the street. Cheap and lively place to unwind after a lovely dinner.",1
36118,1814,5.0,1,2011-04-09,This is the best burger I had in New York. But it probably has to do with the Roquefort cheese in it. Delicious! They have seats by the bar upstairs! But be prepared to wait even on a Sunday evening.,1
12689,1814,4.0,1,2011-04-07,"So after the Yelp Elite Event at Enter Pronoun,  I drag illustrious Yelpers Vivian H, Lisa D, and Taylor M to the west village for a secret spy event at a private townhouse.  On tap was a groovy dance routine performed by SALME Geishas.  Cute would be putting it mildly, but the sad sad sad truth we had to grapple with was that the show was over when we got there.  Well luckly they're playing elsewhere in manhattan over the weekend! … So to sulk a bit in our pain, we headed around the corner to Spotted Pig.  Since none of our band of four had reviewed the place (though I've been there numerous times ) we thought it would be the best spot to go. Turns out I know the hostess there, so we are led upstairs, and given a lovely upfront spot at the bar!!  From there we dig through the menu, order up a cask ale, a six point, and another draft I don't recall.  One of our four was being good on a school night!  Then it turns out Lisa D wanted a cocktail.  So of course Vivian H and I fight over who gets the other draft!  Alright we split it in the end. Mad conversations, and humorous tales keep us yapping away until the place is almost empty, while we stumble onto the street and search for cabs. Ah yes, the humble life of Manhattan Yelpers!",1
8919,1814,4.0,1,2011-04-07,"I have no idea about the food. We just came in for some drinks. A plus for cask ale. But I didn't have any. LOL. I drank an Old Speckled Hen and shared a pint of Six Points with a friend. Both were on tap. Beer any other way is just wrong.   Why did my friend and I share a pint? There was some confusion with another friend about her drink order. This is what happens when inebriated people in a crowded popular bar try to order drinks. Chaos ensues. But never fear! There is never too much beer. Every hour is beer o'clock. The place is cute, milling with people even at 10pm. I bet the food is good, I'll be back to eat.",1
49066,1814,5.0,1,2011-04-06,"It's worth the wait. Trust me. I have been wanting to go here for ages, and finally got around to it. Despite the long wait, it really didn't FEEL that long, Maybe because I was drinking gin and ginger ale while I waited. ;) We started with the deviled eggs and the devils on horseback. Both were delicious and just enough to peak the appetite, but not ruin it. I was FINALLY able to have the burger I had dreamt about for months. Perfectly medium rare, bun toasted just enough, topped with Roquefort. I was in love at first bite. The fries were really, really good. Not too thin, like most shoestrings are. We also split a bottle of wine, which was great, but I was too busy swooning over my food. Oh, and I also got engaged right after this meal, so it will forever hold a special place in my foodie heart. :)",1
7036,1814,3.0,1,2011-04-06,"Ok so I just got back here from lunch. I've wanted to come here for a while since I read that The Spotted Pig had a coveted Michelin Star, so a few co-workers and I hopped on the 1 train to go check it out. My first impression upon arrival is how unassuming the place is. Blink and you'll walk right past it. My co-worker remarked, ""if I didn't know, I would've thought this place was a florist shop."" (it is indeed flanked by shrubs and flowers and foliage.) We went inside and it did open up nicely. You can tell that they don't take themselves TOO seriously when it comes to ambiance and decor. The hostess was incredibly nice and we were seated upstairs within minutes. Service was good as we had a waitress and an ""associate-waiter."" (they kind of alternated helping us; filling our water, clearing our plates, etc, etc). I started off with the chicken liver toast which was very good. I ordered the burger with shoestring fries. The burger was cooked nicely (medium, like I asked), but I wasn't a fan of the roquefort cheese. I would've preferred almost ANY other cheese. The bun was nice and buttery. I was NOT a fan of the shoestring fries however. They WERE tasty, and cooked nicely, but they were SO THIN that they are actually hard to eat, and the amount of work it takes to get them into your mouth isn't worth the payoff when you get them there. I was seriously underwhelmed with my lunch entree. Another knock is that it took a LONG time to get the food. I understand that you need time to cook things right but it seemed like an inordinate amount of time for 2 medium rare steaks, a medium burger and some braised oxtail. I would LOVE to go back and give dinner a try, or at the very least go for lunch but try something else. My co-workers got the flank steak, beets and greens, and the ox-tail, both of which looked delicious and came with happy reviews. For dessert we all split the ginger, walnut and amaretto cake (one of our party is allergic to chocolate so we couldn't get the flourless chocolate cake like we wanted!) and it was good, yet very much like a carrot cake. Its a shame because I LOOOOOOVE carrot cake, so this seemed like carrot cake with something missing. *sigh* I SO wanted to love this place. And seriously, like a battered wife, I think that maybe I'M to blame for picking the food I chose. But as a review, I just can't HIGHLY recommend it to anyone else. Chicken liver toast, ambiance and service were above par, the burger and shoestrings below. All told, it was about $25 before tip.",0
69211,1814,4.0,1,2011-04-06,"So me and my girlfriend went here last night after hearing about it from our friend from Chicago. While we were in Chicago we tried THE PURPLE PIG and A GIRL AND A GOAT, both were really good spots! So after coming back we had to try it out and see for ourselves. First off, you cant make reservations here. Its kind of a downer but it is worth the wait. We were told that the wait will be around 30 mins so we just hung by the bar and tried the house beer they had ""Spotted Pig Bitter"" (not bad but it was a little too warm for my taste). Also they had something that caught my eye on tap also ""Six Points ""Chocolate Rye Porter"""" (you can taste the hint of chocolate on it but i dont think i will be switching to that brand in my lifetime, props by the way to the bartender for giving us a taste. After 15 mins we were seated, we got one of the worst seats in the house (right next to the pillar) but this would be irrelevant later on. We started off with a bottle of Brooks Reisling 2007 $40. This wine wasnt too sweet and didnt have the full body I normally like but it was good enough. For the appetizer we had the Chicken Liver on toast, WOW WOW WEEEE WAAAA! Im not big on liver spread, the only thing i know is the one that comes from a can but this flipped my world upside down! Me and my girlfriend simulatiously looked at each other in suprise on how rich and flavorful this was. (YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!) Our next dish was the ""Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto"", once again it was right on point! The waitress told us that this was ""flash boiled"" (need to use that in my vocab), well, no matter how they did ! This might be another must try for you readers out there. For the main dish my girlfriend had the ""Grilled Colorado Lamb Leg with Parsnips & Chimichurri"", She enjoyed it but I will have to say that it wasnt the best lamb dish that i have tried. I think it just had a little more spice than i wanted. I got the 'Rolled Pork Belly with Rutabaga & Salsa Verde"". Upon looking at the dish it looked so yummy. After the first ""over seasoned"" (i felt like it had too much salt on it and everything else was just too overbearing for my taste buds).  She suggested to take back the dish and serve me a different dish of my choice but I declined. I was hoping to give it a second chance, maybe the other section of the pork belly would be ""wow"". Maybe the first bite it took was the ""bad"" spot. For dessert we had the ""Walnut, Chocolate & Amaretto Cake"". By this time i was so stuffed that i only had space for a small bite of it. My girlfriend seemed to like it. For myself I was in food coma land, I have no comment on it. So just to finish off, I love this place! I really do, regardless of the main dish i had being off i will come back and I want THE SPOTTED PIG to make me a believer of all their dishes.",1

Average wait at brunch for walk-ins was about an hour. They let us put our name down and called us when our table was ready which is a huge customer service bonus in my book. The place was super crowded, and they put 3 of us at a table for 2, but it sounds worse than it was. After a few drinks we totally didn't care, and our waiter was really nice. I had the brunch special, a smoked haddock & gruyere omelette smothered with bechamel sauce. It was a creamy, it was cheezy, it was HEAVY, but D-LISH! My friends both had poached eggs on a yummy pork hash which they loved. The Bloody Mary's were really unique.

104259,1814,5.0,1,2011-03-31,"West Village's finest!  The Spotted Pig is a place that warms the heart (mine, at least) with its Bitter Ale and Roquefort burger.  When it comes to burgers, this has always been the gold standard for me (vs. the likes of worthy competitors like Minetta Tavern, Bobby Vans and Corner Bistro).  A flavorful blend of LaFrieda beef, the Spotted Pig Burger is always a sight to behold with the charred and crusty burger bun and the mound of shoestring fries that it's served with.  I personally like how patrons can't modify this  we're having it exactly the way the executive chef wants us to have it!  That aside, the rest of the menu compares just as favorably to the burger.  I've always enjoyed the deviled eggs (who would've thought that something so simple could be so good), as well as the gnocchi served with sage.  It's probably worth noting that the gnocchi isn't always on the menu, but when it is, it's always a must have in my book.  In terms of ambiance, the Spotted Pig has always been categorically seen as the first ""gastro-pub"" in NYC.  It's always packed, so be prepared to wait given the democratic ""no reservations"" policy.  Despite that, killing time at the bar is always a great thing to  you never know which celebrity you'll see.  On the numerous times I've been there, I've seen Ralph Lauren, Helena Christensen, and that guy Ryan from the Office.  Come to think of it, this was all on one night.  Nevertheless, going to the Spotted Pig is never about seeing the  it's about experiencing the food, which never disappoints!",1

Upon arrival (at 10:30 pm on a Thursday) we (party of 2) entered the very bustling gastropub and elbowed our way to the host stand. We were told we would have an hour wait for the table so we grabbed a glass of wine at a wine bar down the street and they called us within 45 minutes to tell us our table was ready. The tables are pretty close together and the limited space is even more cramped with the crowds of people congregated at the bar - anxiously awaiting for you to finish so they can sit, but everyone seemed excited to be there - as we were. We started with the Pig Ear salad to share. A, but its like extra crispy bacon. Just go with it, trust. Next I had the braised lamb.

The chicken liver toast is excellent. It rivals ABC Kitchen's, which is saying a lot. I had the ricotta gnuda which was delicious. There was a good balance of richness and the basil on top had an almost crystalized texture, so it disolved in your mouth. They also have Old Speckled Hen beer on tap, which is tasty, as well as their own cask beer called Spotted Pig that you can only get here and at The Breslin (their sister pub in the Ace Hotel).

Started off with the chicken liver toast to accompany our drinks, and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a fan of liver, but this dish was tasty.  Next we had the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto and the speck salad with puntarelle & blood Orange.  The sheep's milk ricotta gnudi are little bite-sized pieces of heavenly cheese-gnocchi type of  things.  I would definitely recommend the dish.   Then came the burgers, and the shoestring fries.  Very good all around.  In some odd sense the burger with the Roquefort cheese reminded me of the burger from Father's Office that I desperately miss from LA.   Rounding up the meal, we decided to try the creme caramel and the ginger cake.  I thought the creme caramel was a bit on the too sweet side, but the ginger cake was perfectly balanced with the sweetness and a hint of spice.   Yes the food is a bit on the pricey side, but I think it is definitely worth it!",1
126018,1814,1.0,1,2011-03-11,"Huffington post reprinted an article of the top burgers in the US and 4 NYC Joints mentioned. First, the Minetta T, not burgers, and they had veal mixed in (wtf?) and the place made me claustrophobic (and reminded me of Savoy :( ), so we went on to the Spotted Pig on west 11th (co owned by JZ ),the greenery out front was inviting, and the layout looked cozy, but decor was pseudo homey like a Walmart (Ebay) rip off of late 80s cozy East Village spots. Unlike the places that the spotted pig is trying to emulate, the decor was slapped together haphazardly, lacking soul. And the staff, although polite enough, seemed to be a Disney version of 1980s East Village. They are definitely trying to orchestrate a look with who they hire. But they are missing the sincerity, since the staff seemed to think everything was great, and seemed to be overly confident that everyone would like everything. The whole scene was a bit hollow. We were delighted to get a corner sofa type seat, which one might assume to be comfy and romantic, but it was very uncomfortable. And I noticed the other diners were even less comfortable. Some one had spilled something on the seat next to ours (pee??), and it was visibly soaked. The staff just laid a napkin over the spot and sat a couple on the soaking upholstery. They looked uncomfortable through out the meal, shifting about and feeling around under their butts. It baffled me that people would put up with anything to eat at some place that some one else says is hip, or good food. Apparently, some people wait an hour to get in!!! We were early, on a Thursday, and it was raining so we did not , so that I actually had to step on my chair in order to hang my rain coat, which dripped on my back for some time. The price was ridiculous ($17 burger ), and no option of altering salt or pepper (huh?) except that I have never had saltier fries (saltier anything) in my , which are fun, but the extra fat and salt load left us feeling quite ill after wards. I cant stand McDonalds, but I must admit that their fries are tastier and dont leave me feeling so ill. No matter how you order your burger, you get it rare, still mooing. No vegetable matter served with burger, no , a person might be left with a strong craving for just a bit of something cool, fibrous, moist, and crisp (lettuce, pickle, tomato, ). Chef my ARSE, get over your bad self, Mario. What kind of CHEF would put that much salt on anything???  And the cheese is extremely pungent , so you can barely taste the , mix of various cuts that are just mush in the after math of trying  far too hard to be chic/hip. The rest of the menu consists of a few things like grilled calves liver with pecarino. , no soul. It seems like they are trying to wow us with ingredient names like someone who strives to use big words to impress. Oh, and the flourless chocolate cake (cake without flour? hmmm, looked like a gelatinous mousse or mud pie) was just ? Like a melted Hersheys bar, only with a more foul after taste. We ordered beer since we noticed that the wine and cocktail glasses were as small as they get, and over priced as well. But, on the bright side, the bun on the burger was not only tasty but also pretty, very very pretty. And the pint of Old Speckled Hen was deelish as usual, but 3 times the price that we pay over here on the East side of town. However, with this type of food and atmosphere, the various collection of co owners will soon have a chain of Spotted Pigs in every mall throughout the the USA, so perhaps it was a wise investment. I imagine that management will provide all new mall employees with corporate tattoos and piercings, and uniforms will consist of perfectly presoiled, dingy and overly worn cotton. Look out TGIF!!! Food and Wine magazine must take bribes. And Huffington post just reprints anything. Dont believe the HYPE. We felt violated, and hobbled home to have a shower.",0
126019,1814,4.0,1,2011-03-10,"Because I am a nerd and have long bus commutes I'm often punctuating my sentences with ""I read it in the New Yorker.""  So when the Spotted Pig was suggested as a dinner place after a long week of art world schmooze, not only was I excited, but informed as well ! The overall experience did not disappoint.  I loved the atmosphere (as a friend pointed out, something about red walls covered in folksy craft art just makes you want to eat), I love all the restaurants in NY that have two stories; you can go up and down and always there's a feeling of something else happening, and the sum of all parts hit the  balance between ""we're a cool, down to earth, no fuss place devoted to food and drink"" and ""we're going to charge you a lot"".   Our wait was quoted at 45 min, and honestly I lost track of time while waiting (thanks to space at the bar, and good company), which is a neat trick if you can do it .  Upstairs at the bar I had my first Pimm's Cup, as it seemed medicinal and I was nursing a headache--it did the trick.  Next, a glass of Four Graces was recommended per the bartender and my friend already drinking it because I like a ""medium"" wine, not too big, not too small, juuust right.  And presto, table time! I ate like a pig.  Is that a pun?  Devils on Horseback (prunes wrapped in bacon) were shameless and delicious.  I've never had this dish with prunes, but it really worked, and held fast to the English-ness that pervades the menu.  Gnudi, though not really English, continued a theme of rich indulgence found in simple ingredients.  Its primary ingredients are cheese (filling) and butter (sauce), so it was perfect to split between four and have just a few bites.  I had the burger, because it is THE burger, and anything that looks so perfect and artificial is an automatic draw for me.  It lived up to its veneer,  although about half way through I was really feeling a massive salt shock and had to halt it there.  Our waiter was knowledgable and attentive, though none here give off an ""at your service"" vibe, in trade you get someone who is genuinely interested or interesting if you manage to spark it. The Spotted Pig has that rare magic of food, place and people, that try as they might, I haven't found genuinely replicated anywhere else.  This little piggy grinned all the way home.",1

126020,1814,4.0,1,2011-03-07,"So as a person who works at Eataly, is a fan of Mario Batali and a lover of fine food and dining (a foodie, yes), I give this place a 4 out of 5. Mainly because my experience was amazing, but the long wait list, fairly expensive entrees and ""plates"" ranging from ($17-$30) and wines by the glass ($10-$20) still seemed a little overpriced for the lax atmosphere that this place exudes. I think Batali's style is to have a laid back atmosphere with amazing food. By lax I mean, the bar tender was covered in tattoos and almost everyone had piercings and a hipster style. People kind of dressed ""ya, I'd going to pick up my laundry after i grab some organic coffee and a vegan burrito."" Everyone was sooo nice though, and the food was damn delicious! Their beers are decently priced, but the wines a little pricey by the glass for a limited selection. Their wines by the bottle have a much better value and selection. Delicious plates! I highly recommend the lentil salad and mozzarella plate. My best friend and each got 2 beers and 2 glasses of mulled wine (BEST I have ever had! Hot sangria anyone?), 2 ""plates,"" and one main course. The bill was a hundo, but 50 per person for a meal that was fully satiating was well worth it. We shared everything, which I highly recommend in order to taste the menu. If you are with a friend and not a date, I highly suggest snagging a bar seat. We got super lucky and snagged a seat at the bar, after being told the wait was an hour and a half for two (granted, a Saturday night at 8:30PM). You have to kind of hover over people to ensure your seat at the bar. Spotted Pig is definitely worth the price, but I wouldn't go every day. Their menu is small and you cannot make substitutions (a typical chef thing in a nice restaurant). Their burger was good, but with no condiments (just a patty and bun with cheese and HUGE portion of incredible fries) was not really worth the price. Everything else, like stated before was delicious (the lentils with grilled radicchio, and mozzarella with arugula). Their sauces are very nice. Next time I want to try the fish and chocolate souffle! MMMM buono :P",1

So when my sister was visiting i decided to go again , and again it was a one hour late which this time i cam prepared to wait (and with a girl is easier.. lol) so we put our names down and went shopping for a little and than we had a seat about 45 min after we put our name down. Is very small restaurant but very cozy and fun, we waited longer for our well done burger but it was worth it in my opinion because it was delicious and the fries too. Me and my sis were not that hungry so we shared a burger and gave great tip to the waiter. I would come back.. some other time. Great restaurants in Ny are always busy and because they are probably worth it. Other good burger choices are burger joint and shake shack at madison park.",1

29009,1814,3.0,1,2011-03-06,"Came here and wanted to just wait a bit before we got a table, but was told that another table wouldn't be available for like 2 hours. Needless to say, we decided to take the table immediately. We were sat right by the host stand and the table had to be pulled out for the DP to sit. We were also pretty close to our neighbors, but it was loud enough that we couldn't really hear their conversation. We didn't want to order too heavily since we weren't starving so we got the Chicken liver toast and the Grilled calf's liver with cippolini onions and pancetta. The toast was good, but I thought it was lacking some flavor. The calf's liver was actually the first time I had liver cooked so that the middle was rare. The combination of the sweetness of the cippolini onions and the acidity of the lightly dressed arugala cut the richness of the liver. Next time we come here, we'll definitely get the popular burger and I'll give the special Spotted Pig beer a taste",0
52235,1814,5.0,1,2011-03-06,Always incredible place. Specializes in local and seasonal veggies as well as house prepared meats and sausages. The burger is amazing; also tried the pork belly and found it to be pretty intoxicating - needed red wine to balance the flavor. Definitely not kosher or a place for vegetarians.,1
126021,1814,4.0,1,2011-03-06,"The good news: The Spotted Pig is pretty to close to perfect.  An English Pub plopped down in the West Village with real british ales on tap and true gourmet food.  The bad news:  everybody knows it.   We tried to go for lunch a couple weeks ago, but the wait (no reservations accepted) was an hour and a half.  Last night we had a strategy, we'd get there early, get our name on the list, go back to our hotel for a spell and then return about the time we expected to get seated.  Bingo, we nailed it.   Got there a little before 5 (dinner seating starts at 5:30), put our name in, left for our hotel (not far away), came back about an hour later, had a pint at the bar and got seated at 6. I had the burger that everybody talks about and it was as good as advertised. Perfectly cooked and so flavorful with just the juicy beef, roquefort cheese and grilled brioche bun, I couldn't bring myself to garnish it in anyway.  The fries are good, very thin, served like a pile of potato hay, again, too flavorful to bury under a condiment.  They are best eaten hot and salty straight up. My wife had the daily special of home-made ham, and the roasted carrots.  The ham was actually supposed to be an appetizer, but since she ordered it as a dinner they supplemented it with some great thick slices of toast and home-made mustard so she could actually make a ham sandwich out of it, which she did.  The carrots were maybe the best tasting vegetable dish I have ever had, they were so savory.  I think on could live on those carrots. One thing to keep in mind: the tables are small and close, and you may be seated on a stool, padded yes, but a stool none the less.  I actually took a star off for that. If you don't mind eating at 6pm, or if you are doing a show after dinner, try going early and avoiding the wait.  Or just pass the time quaffing delicious british ales.  Your call.",1

Okay, so maybe I was just trying to snub this place, but I really can't. Those shoestring fries are perfect. They're addictive - well-seasoned, super crispy, and not greasy at all. I ate with my friend, who probably usually has a bigger appetite than I do, but I somehow ate way more of my fries than he did of his. The burger itself was delicious and cooked just under medium for me. The brioche bun was also slightly crisp on the outside but nice and fluffy inside. We also had 6 oysters, which were slightly salty and briny. It sated my oyster craving. Cocktails here are also great - I had the Italian soda, which had just the right amount of gin and had a great housemade fruit syrup. I could have drank that cocktail all night. The wait is a bit annoying - on a Thursday night at around 6:50, we were told that there would be a 1-1.5 hour wait. We gave them our number and were called back 45 minutes later.

62171,1814,1.0,1,2011-02-22,"This review is for brunch only:  In a word - disappointing.  I was pretty excited to experience the Spotted Pig, having heard so much about the amazing food.  I will say, while some of the food was decent, the entire brunch experience was so awful, I can't muster up even half of another star. First, the waitress was terrible.  My friend doesn't eat pork for religious reasons, so we asked the waitress to serve the bacon on the side so I could have it.  Her response was to snort and say she ""guessed"" she could accommodate the request.  This was only the beginning of her attitude-laden service.  For reasons still unknown, throughout brunch she was sarcastic and rude and created such an exceedingly uncomfortable vibe that we went out of our way to flag down other waitstaff to ask for extra cream, water, etc. Second, we paid an exorbitant amount of money for a donut ""stuffed"" with cream and plum jam which had maybe a dab of both.  We realized we were gypped when the patrons at the neighboring table, who also ordered the donut, cut into it and were greeted with oozy goodness.  To add insult to injury, our donut was dry and stale. Third, my friend (the one who doesn't eat pork) ordered the eggs, biscuit, and (snort) bacon on the side.  The biscuit was raw when she bit into it and when we informed the waitress she said ""that's they way the chef makes them.""  She then took the biscuit down to the kitchen and returned with the same message - ""the sous chef says that's how they make them.""  Oh, I didn't realize biscuits were supposed to be flat and raw, I guess that's why I don't have a Michelin star and you do.  Or maybe that's how they make biscuits in England.  If that's the case, next time I'll order my biscuits down south. Fourth, when one of our neighbors (yes, the ones with the oozy donut) got up to use the bathroom, she knocked an entire bottle of water on our table which dripped all over my camera bag.  Did she stop to apologize?  No, of course not, she just went on her merry way after glancing back at the mess she made.  Now I realize this is not the waitstaff's fault, but did any of them stop to sop up or ask about my bag?  NO!  By this point, we were on our way out and done with this place. It's unfortunate, because there were a few bright spots:  the hostess and the woman who kept our coffee cups filled were exceedingly nice, the shoestring fries were yummy, and my deep fried egg and house made chorizo were delicious.  Despite these positives, I will never, ever return to this place.",0

Yes, our table had three burgers and nothing else. The bun has perfect crosshatch grill marks and a very thin, yet crispy exterior. On the inside however, the bun is the lightest, most fluffy, bread you can find. The beef is also noteworthy, juicy and crumbly, but sturdy enough not to fall apart. The shoestring fries that came with the burger was also laudable. They were incredibly thin, had a crisp shell, and smelled faintly like garlic. In addition, the rosemary mixed into the fries elevated the fries into a multi-dimensional tasting side dish. If you like this, read more of my food writing at !",0

First thing you'll notice upon entering the restaurant is the decor/ambiance - simple, warm and cozy. The wait staff are all noticeably punk with most painted with tattoos and quick to serve up a snarky yet playful conversation.. add on top of that they are extremely knowledgeable not just on the food but the beer and wine list as well. It's fun eating at a place where even the staffers are in on how damn good the food is. After situating myself at my table, I quickly jumped into the lunch menu. First up were the deviled eggs.

They came with an interesting salty sauce, I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was really good and original. Next we tried the ricotta gnudi (best part of the meal!) I would strongly recommend you not leave this place without ordering this dish. We decided to share the pork belly as our entree which came with greens and grits. Sooo amazing! The pork belly had this mouth watering hard crust that tasted unlike any pork dish I've ever had. The greens were super flavorful as well. If I could get the recipe for these greens, I would make them everyday. You should come on a day when you have time to spare cause it's usually an hour wait minimum and you can't make rsvp's ahead of time. We got lucky and only waited 45min. on a Friday night around 7p.

Some people may find the cheese to be overpowering (it can be) but I can still taste the sweet, juicy meat.  The waited suggested putting some of the shoestring rosemary garlic fries in the burger to add some texture when you bite into it.  I tried it and it tasted pretty good. The fries dampen the cheese flavor a bit.  The fries are okay - they are thin, hence the name, so there isn't much texture contrast but they are tasty.  The last time I was there I had the Cubano. WOW. Everyone raves about the burger but almost no one raves about the Cubano. It was delicious. The pickles on the Cubano were exactly what I wanted. If you go with a friend I would split a burger and Cubano and get the Gnudi as an app. You won't leave disappointed. I've heard good things about the Chowder so I'll have to give it a try the next time I'm in town!",1

Get over yourself - Pretentious Greenwich Village people - Kinda expensive - Not the most comfortable eating set up - my friend ate on a 'm back to being a vegetarian. That said, it was delicious, I just was having an adverse reaction to eating meat. The fries were incredible. Some of the best ever. Definitely would have those again.

126032,1814,5.0,1,2011-02-05,"I do not like bleu cheese!  I mean I really do not like bleu cheese. On advice of my friend's friend, we went to Spotted Pig.  We went specifically to try the burger. Once I discovered that Roquefort was the key ingredient for their burger, I became very wary.  Because, as I stated above, I do not like bleu cheese. I soldiered on though. The appetizers were all amazing.  Such wonderful mozzarella.  My friend enjoyed her deviled eggs.  This must be my I don't like things review.  Because I am a southern boy who does not eat deviled eggs.  I figured I was already stepping out with the bleu cheese on the burger.  So, while I was tempted, I did not try the deviled egg.  But all the apps that I did try were all five star. Ok, now to that pesky bleu cheese.  The burger arrived with a huge heaping side of shoestring fries.  It actually didn't look that amazing or anything.  It was on a nice bun and it was a well-portioned burger.  But I didn't look at it and think ""wow, this is going to be one of the best burgers i have ever eaten"".  But it was.  First, the meat was of amazing quality.  Second, it was cooked perfectly.  And, for some reason, for the amount of time it takes to savor a great burger, I loved bleu cheese!   It was a heavenly experience.  It was simple.  Straightforward, quality well-selected ingredients combined with excellent preparation coming together perfectly. My friend also really enjoyed her burger and the entire experience at Spotted Pig. During the meal, the shoestring fries were the only thing that did not stand out.  They were just basic shoestring fries.  Good but not spectacular. Plus, I was able to wash it down with Old Speckled Hen.  Such a great beer and went perfectly with the burger. I still do not like bleu cheese. ps - no reservations - there will be a wait.  for us, it was 90 minutes.  we just went to a little wine bar down the street and had some drinks.  we weren't in a hurry. but not spotted pig would not be a good option before a scheduled event.   also the room is lively.  great vibe going on.  i thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Being a gastropub, the food is on the heavy side, but you will love every drop of fatty deliciousness it offers.  I got the burger, which was probably the best burger I have ever had.  The combination of toasty brioche bun, perfectly medium rare patty, and salty rocquefort works perfectly.  The cheese is very strong and may not be for everyone's liking; with that said I eventually found the cheese too salty, but also think the burger would taste great sans cheese. Will definitely be back for more.",1

I've eaten a million deviled eggs, but there was something that set these ones apart, a slightly acidic taste? I'm not sure, regardless they were great (my friend thought they had a funny aftertaste, pshh).

12844,1814,5.0,1,2011-01-28,"The Spotted Pig has been a popular hangout since it has first opened.  Celebrities love to gather around the bar on either of the first two floors, and some of the city's top chefs sneak up to its hidden after-hours attic.  Plus, with the down-to-earth, locavore Executive  Chef, April Bloomfield, this place just oozes coolness. I had once visited The Spotted Pig solely for drinks and had loved the fun, country-style decor and relaxed atmosphere.  I had been dying to try the cuisine and was ecstatic to learn that one of my clients had requested it for a corporate lunch.  My colleagues and I arrived at the quaint corner spot and joined our business partners around a lengthy, rectangular table.  We were all healthy eaters (aka pigs, not vegetarians) and decided to begin by sharing several items off of the bar snack list.  The Deviled Eggs had the perfect balance of firm egg white and creamy yolk.  Scallion shavings and paprika were sprinkled across the top of each egg for some added flavor.  The Marinated Olive dish included a wide variety of the briny Mediterranean item, introducing us to their various flavors.  The Devils on Horseback sweet dates were stuffed with gooey cheese and wrapped in smoky bacon.   The Roasted Almonds were an additional treat, but nothing fulfilled the fattening reputation of this gastropub quite like the Chicken Liver Toast.  The crusty slices of artisan ciabatta were covered with the heavy, rich liver spread.  Though a few of the diners were hesitant to sample the unique paste, they instantly became hooked after just a simple bite. Due to such a lavish appetizer tasting, I decided to order something a bit more manageable for my main course, such as the Smoked Haddock Chowder, which was well-seasoned and served as the perfect portion to round out the rest of the heavy meal.  I also took a bite or two of several of my companion's plates.  The Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi were round heavy dumplings that possessed dense centers of the mild, creamy cheese.  A decadent, buttery broth cradled the dense pasta and fresh basil leaves added a herb garden essence to the dish.  The thick, humongous Chargrilled Beef Burger patty was moist with flavor and served on a crusty, toasted bun.  Roquefort cheese was draped across the meat and a side of thin shoestring fries was a playful accompaniment. By this point, we were all stuffed beyond belief and ready to roll ourselves back to our offices, but we still could not pass up the opportunity to try the Walnut, Chocolate, and Amaretto Cake.  This dense pastry was packed with nuts and topped with a thick chocolate ganache.  The dessert was as sinful as the rest of the menu items. The Spotted Pig truly embodies an English pub with its rustic decor, fabulous beverage list, and comforting food.  Though stopping here for a drink is a fun experience, nothing beats a sampling of Chef Bloomfield's culinary decadence.  Unfortunately, the indulgent meal is something best done in moderation.",1

We were seated right when they were done serving from the lunch menu (I think it was 3:15 or so), and because there's a weird window of time before you can order from the dinner menu, our options were pretty limited.  That being said, the food was really good for being a limited menu.  We had soup and various sandwiches, and everything was tasty tasty tasty.  Especially the shoestring fries. I'll admit, for a well-regarded place, I was kind of expecting the staff to be pretentious, but they were pretty darn polite and relaxed.  I would return to The Spotted Pig again, but seeing how I no longer work around the corner, I no longer have a place to work at while waiting for a table.  Tear.",0

126034,1814,5.0,1,2011-01-24,"I heard about this place before visiting New York, and when I did I had to try it. I came here for a late lunch on a weekday. Mind you, by this time I had already consumed some New York Pizza for an early lunch.. but I had to fit everything I wanted to eat into my 4 day vacation. Therefore I ordered the burger with Roquefort cheese. In short, it was an amazing culinary creation. It was one goddamn perfect burger. The ingredients consisted of only two things: Roquefort cheese and the beef , savory cheese added a great layer of flavor to the perfectly cooked, half-inch patty. And when I say it was perfectly cooked, it was goddamn perfect and they didn't even ask me how I wanted it cooked. They just knew that it should be cooked medium-rare/medium and there was no other way. The shoestring fries that came alongside the burger is also worth mentioning. Although I like thicker-cut fries, I didn't mind these.. especially since they were accented with rosemary and garlic chips. I'm drooling right, back in my home in SF thinking about that damn burger. It was one of the few places I visited in the city that wasn't overrated, and I enjoyed every moment of my 30 minutes at Spotted Pig. I will be back one day for sure because when you taste something this good, it's a sin not to eat it again.",1
33573,1814,4.0,1,2011-01-23,"On a Sunday before a Monday holiday, a friend and I randomly wandered up to NYC from Philadelphia, in part because my friend wanted to check out The Spotted Pig. And really - is there a better reason for a random road trip than good food and drink?! In any case, we arrived at The Spotted Pig a bit on the later side for dinner, I want to say around 10:00pm. But there was no rush as the kitchen doesn't close till 2am. We didn't have a reservation and there was a little bit of a wait - maybe 15 minutes or so - until we were seated. And the place was full - but not overwhelmingly so. The first floor features a compact bar with a small dining room. The second floor offers more tables, another bar and is a bit more spacious - that's where we were seated. The place is warm, cozy and chock full of various pig things - no surprise there. Low lighting and a very relaxed feel - intimate, but with great energy. Groups maneuvered in and out with little difficulty despite the small space. We split the burger and my companion was rather delighted that every available surface of the bun was toasted. The accompanying shoestring fries were addictive. Before that we went a bit devious and ordered the Deviled Eggs AND the Devils on Hoseback (bacon wrapped oysters), which were polished off in very short order. And the gnudi - heavenly little dumplings filled with ricotta - is a must. I'm salivating just thinking about the dish. There are no words to describe the extent of the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. As for beverages, he ordered a few beers and I stuck with the Pimm's Cup -  pleasant reminder of my time spent in England.

And I didn't think the deviled eggs were anything special. The Salty Dog we ordered was good, but not great. The biggest con was, of course, the wait. 1.5 hours is just too damn long for anything that isn't spectacular. That said, it was a relaxed Sunday night with my sister and we happily sipped bears at the Otheroom (loved, great beer selection and atmosphere, highly recommend) while we waited, so the long wait was very tolerable that night. I probably wouldn't go back given the super long wait and cramped quarters, but I wouldn't object if others insisted!

I do have the say although the wait was long the host was able to keep track of us at the bar and found us when our table was ready, We were seated in the back room upstairs but was lucky enough to get one of the corners. My date got the Gnudi and I had the Porkbelly. Both were really delicious, the Gnudi was well seasoned and had the perfect amount of sauce.

I figured it was a true food lovers hang out and the servers would love to talk about the menu. We had a couple drinks which were fairly small for the price, but really good. We started off with the brussel sprouts. These were overcooked with too much carmelization. I had the pork belly, which I normally love. This had not been cooked long enough and was tough and chewy. The fat layer too thick and rubbery. The flavor was there and was outstanding, but the execution was not. My wife had the gnudi. It had a weird film on the exterior. The gnudi was kind of bland.

My first visit was with my parents on the night of a huge snow storm. It was so good that when I went back to New York with my man two weeks later, Spotted Pig had to be on the itinerary. The first time during the storm, the place was jammed. Despite it being a white-out outside, we had to wait an hour for a table. No problem, we got cozy at the bar with a few $8 draughts (NYC prices, people) and made small talk with our neighbors. We were seated upstairs in a sea of pig paraphernalia. The decor feels more like an English pub that has been around since the dawn of time than a trendy downtown eatery. My parents and I split the gnudi for starters (AMAZING). My dad had the calf liver special, and my stepmom and I both had burgers. Yes, the burger is salty (it's the Roquefort cheese), but the meat is amazing. When ordered med-rare, it actually comes out as ordered. The meat is juicy and fluffy, and you can tell the it wasn't beaten to death on the grill by some line-cook. My stepmom couldn't stop talking about the New Yorker article, so see the for more info. The huge pile of rosemary fries was more than enough, and the garlic shavings in the was a nice surprise. Also, this place actually makes a decent cappuccino. Our server had some troubles with our bill (forgot the drinks, accidentally put someone else's dessert on it), but she comped an $18 glass of wine to make up for it. No points lost for that, we all make mistakes, and she was really sweet. My boyfriend and I went back this week. We showed up after midnight for dinner, and the place was more quieter than my last visit. Kitchen is open until two, which is so good to know. I basically forced him to eat what I wanted, so we split the gnudi (still AMAZING) and the burger. It was just enough food for both of us. We followed it up with a creme catalan (more like a brule than any creme catalan I've had before, but fine by me), and I had a glass of port (yum). Our server was down-to-earth but still folded my man's napkin when he used the WC. Soundtrack of Kanye and Bowie kept me happy, and the bartender's dance moves kept me entertained.",1
21267,1814,5.0,1,2011-01-11,"I almost once fought a friend for a turnip here. We ordered the turnip greens as a side and they were so heavenly that we ate them with a focus that I hadn't had in a while. When the last green had been pierced by my friends fork (took a lot out of me to let her have it), a turnip was revealed to be hiding underneath it. I literally squealed (joyfully) at the sight of it. I don't squeal. But the surprise of the squeal bought me just enough time to swoop in and snag the crispy on the outside, yet so succulent on the inside turnip chunk. We also ordered the burger. It was incredible. The cheese was so perfectly salty and the meat full of flavor and the perfect amount of juicy. It comes with  mound of crispy potato sting fries. It baffles me how you are supposed to eat them politely. I tend to start off jabbing at the mound with my fork, but after the first bite, I throw my pompous manners out the window and shovel them into my mouth with my bare hands. It's my go to place when i want a delicious, inspiring, palate pleasing meal. Oh, and I ran into the guy from U2 here. The one that wears the cap.

Once we were seated we ordered the deviled eggs, devils on horseback, and chicken liver toast. Oh my god the chicken liver toast is something I could eat every fucking day. SO DELICIOUS. The deviled eggs were really good too, really rich and smooth with great flavor. The devils on horseback were good, but not my favorite. My friend really loved them though. Next we ordered the sheeps milk gnudi, the prosciutto ricotta tart with marjoram, and the fluke crudo. The gnudi was really great, very creamy and subtly sweet. The prosciutto tart was excellent, it was like a puff pastry type tart with prosciutto and marjoram. It was soOOOOOOOOO good, so light and airy. It was like a bomb ass salad over puff pastry (which is like my favorite thing EVER). The crudo was 'm not huge on sashimi but it was fresh and light so it was a good thing to have since we ordered like everything on the menu. For our entree meal my friend and I ordered pork belly with a side of Brussels sprouts. The pork belly was good, but not as good as I would have liked. I think we got a piece with a higher fat ratio than normal, because it was like 100% fat instead of having a little meat on it. It was probably the richest pork belly I've ever had so I couldn't eat much of it. I think it would have been really good if it had something to cut the richness. My friend loved it though, I think it was her first time having pork belly too (she's a ""vegetarian""). THE BRUSSELS SPROUT ARE INSANE! They were so tender and perfectly caramelized. It was my friend who insisted on ordering them but I am really glad we did. I bet their other sides are incredible as well. For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the creme dessert (creme brulee). They were both amazing. The chocolate cake was delicious and dense and really rich but so divine (i'm not even a chocolate fan) and the creme one was awesome too.

We started our meal with roll mops (pickled herrings with onions), which, for a seafoodie like me, are just the way I like them--briny and fishy (so this might not be suitable for people who don't like briny fish).  I had the lentil salad with arugula and parsnip chips, and when I got my salad, I was somewhat confused by the fried little flakes in my dish.  At first I thought it was fried lentils, but then I realized it was parsnip!  Totally cool to see parsnip fried in such fashion--definitely a first for my palate!  I have to say I actually had fun eating this salad. My friends got the burger and the pork belly.  Not being the fan of pork, the pork belly tasted quite good--fried lightly and flavorful.  [Caution: beer and pork belly might result in gastric overload and moments of discomfort.]  The burger was good as well, and the shoestring fries were a good compliment to it (although I prefer my fries a little thicker).

Part of a servers job, especially when they are speaking to someone who may have a little bit of an idea where they're coming from, is to not only sell dishes but not necessarily to upsell every course.  Additionally, when a guest puts full faith in a server to order for them, it is tasteless for a server to select only the priciest menu items and beverages.   I have really enjoyed my visits, but being someone who enjoys having the restaurant's selection, having servers order high and over-order each time is discouraging in the quality of staff.",1

We ordered the Gnudi and the famous burger. Both were perfection. Gnudi is pasta stuffed with ricotta and served in brown butter with sage sprinkled on top. Burger - we ordered ours medium rare and it was served with bleu cheese and fries - DELICIOUS. Service was flawless. I couldn't have asked for more. We waited over an hour for our table (expected) and the beers were overpriced and just ehhh. But the food and service makes up for these flaws. Go, April Bloomfield!",1

Great beef, delicious cheese, toasted buns and a heaping of skinny fries. Everything goes together great and is very complimentary.

Put our name and number down and proceed to walk around the neighborhood and grab a few drinks while we wait. 10:30 pm - We arrive and are promptly seated in a nice corner table, conveniently located within centimeters of the table to the right and left. Drinks ordered: Six Point and a Bulldog Gin martini. Six point is great as always. Martini is excellent.  The sauce is on point and the olives they use put it over the top. 11 pm - The Gnudi arrives. Excellent. While all the components are great, the fried sage ties it all together and the plate is basically cleaner than when it came out of the dishwasher. The busser asks ""are you finished?""... Rhetorical question? 11:15 pm - Bridge and tunnel couple sits down to the right (as evidenced by the NJ Transit schedule poking out of her purse). 11:30 pm: Burgers arrive. Incredible. The burger is worthy of all the laudatory declarations made here on yelp and elsewhere. The fries are addictive. The modern, gourmet equivalent of Pringles (in the most positive sense). On another note, second round is ordered. Another Six Point and an Italian Soda from the cocktail list. 11:50 pm - Something is brewing with the B&T couple to the right. Guy sees a girl he knows. Girlfriend is not happy. She leaves. Comes back. Leaves again. Another guy shows up. Now it's two dudes and the girl has Caspered/ghosted/disappeared. 12 am - Burger is finished. Picking at fries. Feeling satisfied and working on the drinks. Girl with NJ Transit schedule comes back to the table. Sits down clearly upset. Shuffles into the booth, grabs her 5th glass of wine and knocks the Italian Soda all over our table. Doesn't say a word. 12:10 am - After clean up, the waitress who has been awesome all night comes over and offers to buy us a round. We order a Speckled Hen and one last Six Point. 12:35 am - Exit Spotted Pig. Overall the food was as promised, the drinks were excellent and the service top notch (extra points for the waitress rolling her eyes at the B&T drink-knocker-over when she ordered another glass after aforementioned spillage and then offering a round for said incident).",1

35782,1814,2.0,1,2010-12-18,"Lets get right down to business. My partner and I had no problems with the bartender or maitre'd. We arrived at 11 and were seated by 1130 as expected. Although I'll have to say, $20 for 2 draft beers is a bit much. We started with a half dozen Mignonette oysters served with a horseradish vinegar, they were meaty and very delicious but they took quite a while to come out and I was starving considering we had been there an hour. The entree also took a while to arrive, this gave us time to finish our beers and notice our server would take our empty glasses away without bothering to ask if we wanted another, also it would have been nice to have had some bread or something at this level of dining. I throughly enjoyed my striped bass, it was wonderful but the portion was a bit small and the cauliflower that was to accompany it, was virtually non-existent (all of it would fit in one spoonful). My partner had the sauteed calf liver with a caramelized onion sauce on top and mashed potatoes, bacon and fried sage. This entire plate was a disappointment (except the bacon). The calf's liver (which we were told had a mild liver flavor) was actually quite pungent and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The mash were so incredibly light and fluffy (not a lump to be found of any sort) but unfortunately the flavor was also incredibly light because neither of us tasted much of anything, definitely not what we would expect of a 5 year Michelin star restaurant. I'll have to add that the area we were seated in had very tiny cafe tables that couldn't even fit both our plates without overhang and the area was so cramped in general the guy next to me twice wiped his hand on my leg by mistake and I was constantly kicking our female neighbor on the other side as would she which left us both apologizing regularly. All in all, it was a poor experience, uncomfortable and cramped and utterly unspectacular. I'm saving the best for last, the beets and greens side dish was absolute heaven, if I was in the neighborhood, I might be tempted to stop in just to grab one to take out, but for nothing else.",0

No more Aquavit, Le Bernardin or any of the other fine dining establishments. Last night I had a friend from the restaurant industry visit me and he wanted to try a high quality restaurant without spending his life savings. I heard of the spotted pig as being a great restaurant/bar with moderate pricing and have always wanted to dine here. Very unassuming at first glance we passed by the spotted pig which looked like a neighborhood bar in a picturesque NYC neighborhood. The decor inside was ""rugged"" , yet reminiscent of an Abercrombie and Fitch store (if that makes any sense). We opted to sit at the bar and the bartenders were professional courteous and friendly. The bartender handed us a menu of the day on a piece of paper. They have a ""tapas"" section although they called it something else. Being two big guys we decided to try everything on the tapas menu. The most memorable ones were the deviled eggs, bacon wrapped figs and OMG the chicken liver on country toast was so unbelievable my mouth is watering just writing about it. We actually ended up ordering another order of this it was that good. Imagine sweet caramelized onions, perfectly cooked chicken liver, melt in your mouth, perfectly toasted bread, i don't know how else to describe it. Following that we looked at the ""appetizers"" the bartender recommended something that sounded like gnocchi but was something else with sheep cheese bechamel and veal stock i think. Honestly I would pass on that, it wasn't anything worth remembering. We also ordered an Apple salad, which was two variations of apple i think figi and golden delicious, dressing that tasted like plum vinaigrette, arugula for spice, and pieces of a sharp white cheese. This marriage of flavors danced on our palate for a while we loved it. Main course we opted for the Burger (I didn't want it but my friend insisted on it since we saw a few interesting plates come out) and the Skirt steak, Both medium rare. As the meal arrived my friend wanted to try the steak first and his expression can only be described in a picture. He hit the table with his hand and said ""wow"" ""forget the burger, try this steak"". Seeing his enthusiasm I tried the steak and it was one of the best steaks I have ever tasted in my life. The texture was a nice char grilled crisp on the outside and tender like butter on the inside, smoked herb flavors from the grill infused the meat and were noticeable but not overpowering. Charred sweet beats were served on the side and overall one of the best entrees I have had in my life. 10/10 The burger, nice flavor liked the blue cheese touch ... but overall there are better places to get a burger in nyc. To conclude if you do visit this gem make sure you try the chicken liver toast, the apple salad, and the steak. Amazing.",1

22519,1814,3.0,1,2010-11-08,"The trick to avoiding the massive lines (at least for brunch) is to arrive a few minutes before they open (11:00 ).  We arrived a few minutes before 11:00 and even though the rest of our party didn't arrive until 11:15 (everyone has to be present to be seated), we had no trouble getting a table. It's definitely pricey for brunch (16-18 an entrée) and the food is hit or miss.  Some dishes were absolutely delicious, while others were just okay.  Let's start with the good: the lemon ricotta pancakes were heavenly and literally melted in my mouth.  They came just as advertised, complete with toasted almonds that added a perfect crunch.  The salmon plate (it was a special) was tasty, but very simple (literally lox, onions, capers, parsley and lemon - where were the carbs??).  Definitely could have made this at home and saved a lot of money.  We also ordered a whole wheat biscuit that came with honey butter.  The outside was crispy and delicious, but the inside was undercooked and soggy.  I had a bite of my friend's grilled cheese, which was heavy, but very yummy.  The shoestring fries were also a hit with our table.  I have a soft spot for skinny fries, and these were skinny perfection.   The atmosphere is very cute and similar to what I imagine would be the setting for the Mad Hatter's tea party.  I loved that there were coat hooks next to each table and there was both a high and low hook (it's all in the details!).  My only gripe decoration wise was the abundance of cute piggy banks/pig pictures - there were cute pigs everywhere and 90% of the menu items featured some sort of pork - does that creep anyone else out?  It just seems wrong. In sum, get the lemon ricotta pancakes - amazing!! (If half stars were available, I would have given 3 1/2 stars).",0

I successfully steered them away from Magnolia Bakery, although I think the tsunami of inappropriate tube tops, orange tans and big earrings washing over the sidewalk might also have had something to do with it. The next target was The Spotted Pig. Very charismatic space and staff although I have to admit that, in all my visits to the UK, I've never met anyone quite as laddish the waiters here. Everyone decided on the famed burgers. During the short wait for our food I entertained myself by watching Danny Bonaduce's dinner companion eat his entire entree. Stand up for yourself, man! My companions hadn't heard of Mr Bonaduce. Oh, kids. The rosemary shoestring fries were very tasty, but the burgers were horrible. Salty, salty, salty. Like triple-salto-with-a-twist salty. A hush descended over the table as the bubble of hype rapidly deflated. Being the designated grumpy codger of the day, I flagged down our waiter to notify him of the salt lick situation at our table. Not unpleasantly, he responded that Roquefort is a very salty cheese and that's probably what it was. E? The kiddies were starting to look uncomfortable, expecting a tirade, so I let the matter drop with a simple request that the kitchen go easier on whatever it is that makes these burgers so very salty. With nothing left to say, we made ready to leave. Meanwhile, at the Bonaduce table Danny's plate was in the final stages of being polished clean. I probably won't return to find out if the salt licks were a random misfire (although I am sort of curious about what Danny Bonaduce got that his companion enjoyed so much). There are far better things I could do with $17. Besides, a gypsy told me that every time someone eats one of those hideously salty burgers an angel dies of hypertension. At least I didn't eat more than a couple bites of mine so maybe my angel is only parched and bloated.",0

You can sometimes wait a long long time for a table but there is plenty of things to do while waiting: - drink at the bar downstairs - drink at the bar upstairs - go around the block to Rusty Knot - order apetizers (the chicken liver and the devils on horseback are amazing) Then when you are finally sitted and ready to order, please make sure you try at least once the fabulous roquefort cheese burger (main course) and the gnudis (apetizer). I can't believe they took the ricotta tart off the menu last year and never put it back ! Enjoy the true Gastro pub ",1
21176,1814,3.0,1,2010-11-02,"Came here for a late lunch on a weekday and had no problem getting seated quickly. Started with the chicken liver toast. The liver was creamy and rich, but a little too salty. The toast was perfect - it was neither too crunchy nor too hard. Also tried the deviled egg which was a little sour and a little spicy. The egg was good but not great. I ordered the burger and it was juicy and cooked as I ordered it (medium). The cheese that came on the burger was very salty, and the burger itself doesn't need condiments added to it. The bun was hearty enough for the meat. It was a good burger but not so memorable that I would say it is the best ever. The fries were not crunchy enough for me but had fried rosemary and garlic mixed in, which added a nice flavor. My wife got the Cubano sandwich. The pork was tender, and the cheese and jalapeños were great with the meat. The bread was crunchy and warm. The arugula salad had a little too much lemon and salt. The decor was kitschy with a lot of pig paraphernalia on the shelves and walls. The service was good and the food was good but if I had to wait an hour or two to eat, I would be disappointed. It did not live up to the hype.",0

105761,1814,4.0,1,2010-10-31,"I have been a Spotted Pig fan for some time now but for some reason or another have not given it its due review.  The Pig was one of the first restaurants I had been recommended to visit by one of me restaurant co-workers when I first moved out to the big apple.  Two and a half years later, it still holds a special piece of my hungry heart and remains one of my favorite NYC restaurants.   The Service: When you first step into the Pig, you will see that the quirky decor, the brick walls, the casually dressed service staff that make it the go to gastropub of the NYC.  The actual dining area (minus the new second floor) is quite small and tight.  The service staff has always been friendly and helpful.  However, I have found that the actual food service to be slow.  So just as a fair waring, you may or may not have ample time between courses.  Make sure your w/ good company! The Cuisine: From what I take, a gastropub is a restaurant institution that serves a combination of tasty gastronomical treats (gastro-) and great beer and wine (-pub).  Taking from the handful of times that I have visited, the Pig is absolutely the pinnacle of what a true gastropub should be.  For a bit of the breakdown of the menu, there are some staples and seasonal dishes that the Pig offers.  Here a quick rundown of their staples. Pot o' Pickles: If you like pickles, you'll definitely have to try these house pickled pickles.  Sour, tart, crunchy and oh so tasty.   Chicken Liver and Toast: Now i'm not the biggest Chicken Liver fan.  But Chef April Bloomfield will make your hungry tummy a happy tummy with this snack. Haddock Chowder:  Silky but chunky chowder that warms the body, tummy, and heart.  Oh yeah, its pretty damn tasty too.   Sheeps milk ricotta Gnudi:  This ""naked ravioli"" brown butter and sage plate might be one of the best dish I have EVER eaten.  A definite must try when you are here.  Absolutely mouth watering!   Burger with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries: Two of my favorite things in world - meat and blue cheese.  What makes this dish even better, is that it is a LOT of meat and blue cheese.  The garlic and rosemarey shoestring fries are a nice accompaniment to boot.   I've had a Handful of their seasonal dishes and I have yet to run into one I have not liked.  Now, I am pretty bias towards the PIg's Staples, but if you think you will be a multiple visitor like me, definitely don't be afraid to venture and give other things a try.   The Drink: I swear that the Spotted pig serves the best EVER ginger ale.  Perfectly fresh, cold, carbonated and gingery.  There are also a nice selection of beers and wines available.  One of my personal favorites Pork Slap Pale ale is served here.  And at $5 a ?!? As far as I'm concerned, the Spotted Pig was love at first bite.  Definitely a must eat when living and/or visiting NYC.",1

Since I went with a group of five, we arrived early at 7 pm for dinner and had to wait about 30-35 minutes to be seated. I ordered a cocktail - the Salty Pig - and was a bit underwhelmed. I was expecting to taste a bit more of the mix of the salty and the sour/sweet of grapefrruit, but it tasted a bit watered down. The place is small, adding an intimate vibe, which is great for hanging out with friends and being able to have conversations without having to yell over loud patrons or music.

We sat at the upstairs bar and enjoyed a delicious beer while we waited for our table. The place is very tight- but had a great atmosphere and our server was awesome. The food was absolutely delicious. I had read reviews that the place was over-hyped but I could not disagree more. We had the deviled eggs and devils on horseback from the bar snack menu and they were awesome. The squash salad was great too- but not the dish I would be running back for. Now for the main course- we had the bass, the pork shoulder and the gnudi and all shared. The gnudi were on of the best things I have ever tasted- I was tempted to order more.   The bass was cooked perfectly with very crispy skin. The pork shoulder was very rich and tender. It seemed like the majority of the people around us had the burger- which also seems to get rave reviews.",1
17378,1814,5.0,1,2010-10-28,"We went out last night for my friend's birthday, and I think I have a new favorite restaurant.  It's a little annoying as they don't take reservations and are ridiculously popular, and I've never come close to waiting 2 hours for a table before, but I knew it would be that long, and prepared by eating a good amount of vegetables ahead of time.  We went at the worst time, about 8 pm (even though I thought it might not be bad, as it was a Wednesday), so at other times the wait must not be as bad.  Here is my only criticism: As a former hostess, and as anyone in a restaurant should know, the first cardinal sin is exceeding a quoted wait time.  As in, if you are 99% sure a table will be available in 30 minutes, you should tell a customer the wait is 45 minutes, and thus they will be pleased when in fact it takes less time.  In the event that estimated wait time is exceeded, it is paramount to offer increasingly offended customers a token such as a free drink or appetizer, either while they continue to wait, or deducted from their bill.  However, it sounds like everyone waits a really f*ing long time here, and as modus operandi, that would mean the Pig would bleed freebies. But to get to the point: it was incredibly good.  The Spotted Pig is a ""gastro pub,"" which may sound lame and pretentious, but is a perfect descriptor.  A small tavern in Greenwich Village, reviewers claim its burger single-handedly won it a Michelin star, and I whole-heartedly support that conjecture.  Five of us ordered stuff and shared everything, and it was all amazingly good.  Bacon-wrapped figs, homemade picked veggies, deviled eggs, lentil salad with parsnip chips, gnudi (like mini pierogi, little balls of pasta filled with creamy ricotta-like cheese, in a brown butter sauce that tasted like melted gold), le burger medium-rare with Roquefort, and rosemary-garlic shoestring fries (the garlic and rosemary were deep-fried with the potatoes, so you could crunch them whole), a braised lamb dish with creamy polenta that just tasted like awesome roast beef, and an orangey creme brulee and chocolate cake for dessert.  It was the perfect meal.  All I can add is imagine what you want each of these dishes to taste like in your dreams, go there, open your eyes, eat, and smile, smile, smile.",1
64813,1814,4.0,1,2010-10-27,"A cozy little spot in the West Village that gives lie to the concept that Michelin stars are only given for stuffed French shirts. The Spotted Pig feels like it's been there for years, it's a casual bar, low lit with a kitschy floral motif. Jam packed, even on a Sunday night, there are no reservations so get your name down on the list or snag a spot at the old wood bar and knock back cocktails, Guinness or pints of Old Speckled Hen. Despite the porcine title, the menu has a fair few veggie options and rediscovered classics on their relatively small menu. We went for 70's dinner party staple Devils on Horseback (Unami packed prunes wrapped in moreish salty proscutio ham). Following that, our first night in New York had to be celebrated with a burger, it's not cheap at $17 but came packed with flavour, fighting (not entirely successfully) with an unannounced blue cheese topping. Served in a grilled brioche bun it comes with an enormous side of shoestring fries, catwalk model thin and cut with rosemary and garlic, fried into chewy golden coins. I can imagine it irritating when you've got to wait 2 hours for a slot at the bar, but it's a great call for a Sunday evening.",1

However, it was all downhill from there. If you want little bang for your buck and to get treated like dirt, go here. I worked in an upscale restaurant for many years, so I give most people in the industry the benefit of the doubt when it comes to service. You could be having a bad day, tired, etc. But our server quite honestly didn't give a flying flip about us, never checked on us, never smiled once, never said please or thank you once, and looked like he was trying to act comatose when dealing with us. You know it's bad when the guy who brings your food is markedly friendlier than the guy taking your order/asking for your tip. Also, the food was mediocre at best. I had the deviled egg, which was oversalted and sparsely garnished. If I'm paying $3.50 for 1 egg, I expect a better effort. Then I had the burger, on which the bun was super stale and ruined the sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the Spotted Pig Bitter beer, though. All in all, very disappointing.

We waited for about an hour and a half at the bar, but had good bar service and we were able to munch on some deviled eggs which were superb and I'm from North Carolina and feel like I'm a pretty good judge of all things Southern.

The befuddled look the host gave me didn't help and the fact that my guy wasn't answering his cell certainly didn't either. I decided to ask one more time before launching into DMX mode: ""Is there a private group in ?"" I saw the light bulb go on over her head and she said, ""Oh !"" She looked down at my heels and luggage and said, ""But it's three flights up."" Oh snap.  ""No worries,"" she said. ""I'll take it up for you."" I implored that she did not have to, but she grabbed my stuff and proceeded up the stairs. At that moment, the other host appeared and he grabbed it and lugged it up there. Now THAT's ! Once we reached the top and found my group, I was happy to see a bunch of drunken, dancing souls having a fabulous time--and my guy was in the middle of it all. So what did I do? I immediately ordered a drink and joined the party. The music was great, although whoever was DJ'ing , who I was standing next to, shook his head in disgust and said he really needed to be on the ones and twos at that moment. He ain't neva lied. Since I had only been to a gastropub once before at my cousin's wedding in London (but didn't eat) I was really curious to eat something just to see what the fuss was all about. After checking out the menu, I ordered the Roquefort burger medium. When they brought me the bleeding burger, I remembered that a NY medium is a Chicago rare, so I sent it back so they could cook it bit more. What they brought back was sheer burger perfection. This juicy, well-seasoned burger smothered with roquefort cheese on a kaiser bun was a party in my mouth. The shoestrings were mmm mmm good and I'm not even a fan of 're usually nothing but a tease. The bartenders, servers and hosts  were very nice and accommodating and we all know folks from NY aren't really any of those things. ;-p. As far as decor, I guess you could call it Gastropub Chic. I mean it looked like a pub, just not dark and dirty and the patrons were well-dressed and behaved--not drunken slobs falling all over the place.

113060,1814,3.0,1,2010-10-04,"All the best qualities of a neighborhood place plus a bartender. I can't say in the last years that we lived in NYC that we spent much time in the Meatpacking District.  No question that it has been developed - and deservedly so.  Designers always did great things with spaces in that neighborhood - you can see it as you walk down Greenwich from 14th Street - at the southerly end of the High Line.  And on the past few trips, I'd been meaning to have lunch at the Spotted Pig (the burger recommended by more than one person).  Not having made it for lunch, we opted for dinner.  It's a convincing neighborhood corner place - without modern accents found in other spots nearby.  No reservations and it was appropriately crowded - so as to say you picked right.  We headed up to the bar upstairs (also appropriately full and lively) - planned on bourbon to prepare for burgers (Bakers).  Old Speckled Hen was recommended by a friendly Scotsman engineer from Orlando sitting at the end of the bar for my wife - always willing to entertain the alternative.  I'm still really surprised by the sub-standard beer options throughout the city.  Add in a friendly bartender, agreeing to the superiority of the beer quality west of the Mississippi - and making recommendations for later.  We watched their burger consumption in preparation.  Once seated, we took a look through the menu and ordered: the Burger, the skirt steak, squash blossoms and fried Pig Ear.  The Squash blossoms were pretty good if not a little tart.  And the pig ear - easily a gamble - was super fried and super tender with a lemon dressing (I'd recommend it to others for both the taste and the novelty).  The skirt steak was well prepared - maybe slightly underdone - and served with beets.  And lastly the burger.  Yes, it is well prepared with quality beef.  But the most outstanding thing about it was the bun.  The burger with roquefort was rich in taste but leaning toward salty.  Would I have it again? Yes.  But at the end of the day, it's just a burger.  It doesn't show the inventiveness and balance of the best of the best.  Put shoestring fries (already not my favorite) on the side and topped with rosemary - I'm lost.  Not a rosemary fan.  Certainly not on fries.  Summary: it's good - even above average.  It's just not great.   A last footnote on the Spotted Pig is the places nearby to drink after.",0

The upstairs bartender was quick and remembered our drinks without needing any reminders which was much appreciated. The beer selection was good and encouraged us to try new things, the cocktails were strong and on point.

Will enjoy that there is a big dollop of it on the burger, which gives it a taste that will leave you wanting more. Not to be outdone, the fries were also heavenly.  The shoestring fries were fried with slivers of fresh garlic and dill which gave every bite of fries a wonderful taste that needed no ketchup. Absolutely amazing. The small plates were also very well made, deviled eggs and the ricotta gnudi were an awesome starter food to pick at. All in all, The spotted pig deserves to be one of the top burgers in town and definitely lived up to its Michelin Star.",1

Warm, cozy type of room that has an old New York feel to it.  I could see coming here with a small group and spending the afternoon drinking sampling from the menu.  I didn't get a chance to check out the bar upstairs, though pics online make it look inviting.   I'll definitely go back to try some more menu items before we fly out of Newark in a few weeks.",1

Oh was it worth , and that was mmmm good, a bit to much relish but after i scraped most of it off it got even better.

If you can imagine, my expectation had been building up over the years. Last night, in my triumphant state I ordered the burger and was deeply disappointed. The shoestring fries were okay, but the only thing that really separates it from regular fries was the rosemary. Nice touch, but no homerun. The : the $17 burger wasn't too special either.

Hmm..I really wish I could remember the names of the things I ate and drank here, but considering the amount of alcohol I consumed from the Rouge wine bar a couple blocks to the north, I don't think that's possible.  Seating takes a while at the Spotted Pig, so pregame at Rouge if you feel so inclined.",1

They also have a good beer selection, although I'd much rather dish-out money for the food than over-priced beer. The food, on the other hand, worth every penny.",1
20984,1814,4.0,1,2010-08-25,Went here for brunch b/c my friend wanted to try their grass fed burger and shoe sting fries. I have to say I was not too impressed. The burger was very salty. I thought I was having a sodium overdose. It must've been b/c of the roquefort cheese. It overpowered the taste way too much for my taste buds. The shoe string fries were good. They had garlic shavings and were sprinkled with oregano and basil. However the grilled cheese was to die for! It's such a simple dish however it was unbelievable. The bread was crispy yet soft and covered with melted parmesan and basil all over. I don't remember what the 3 different cheeses it was made with but the combo was amazing. Every bite had the crispiness from the bread and oozing of soft melted cheeses bursting with flavor in my mouth that almost brought tears of joy to my eyes. The carmelized onions that come with the dish just made it even better.  I also really enjoyed my grapefruit infused vodka that had a hint of ginger and mint. It was a great meal and to top it off our waiter was friendly and quite amusing.,1
49427,1814,3.0,1,2010-08-23,"The burger and shoestring potatoes were  just okay, rather blah and the chef decides that nothing needs to be added.  so if you like onions, don't bother asking for them, you will be ignored.  The chef presumes to know your tastes and preferences better than you.  Even though I asked the waitress to please ask the chef if  I could please have onions I was never responded to. I have had wonderful burgers in San Francisco at Spruce and the chefs try to accommodate the preferences of their guests.

They seated us at about 45 minutes which was a great surprise. The service was good, I have nothing to complain about. Now, lets talk about the food.. We got, chicken toast livers which I loved. The bread was warm, the chicken liver was chunky, in a good way. The deviled eggs were just ok. It had some vinegar on top of it which in my opinion ruined the dish.  The devils on horse backs were not my thing, they were too sweet, but my husband liked them.. The ricotta gnudi were really good.. really good.. with every bite, I was loving them even more. Now, to the best part of the 's burger, but I have to say that Spotted Pig's burger was even better. They both get their meat from Pat La Frieda, the meat  supplier and his meat is the best..The Minetta Tavern's burger has caramelized onions on top of the meat and as much as i love them, I think they mask the taste of the meat a little.. Spotted Pig's burger has meat and blue cheese on a nicely toasted bun.. The taste of the meat accompanied by the saltines of the cheese was really, really delicious.. The shoestring fries were good too.. Salty and garlicky.. I liked the saltines but I did not love the garlic, because it leaves the after taste in my mouth. Anyways, I loved the burger, loved it.

I had the Cuban sandwich was tasty; a little heat.  But, where was the pork? Hard to find!  The Boss had the Prosiciutto and Ricotta tart. The pastry was very light and overall was very good.  Service was slow.  Over a half hour between apps and our dishes.  We ordered one deviled egg each; we were served one that we split.  Maybe we were not clear.  My mother made better deviled eggs; no question.  I am sure my fiancée does too.  I will ask her to get on it as soon as I sign off.",0

126076,1814,5.0,1,2010-08-16,"We just returned from a two week vacation to NYC. During that two weeks we went to the Pig FOUR times. Four times. And it wasn't nearly enough. On our first visit to the Pig, on our first night in NYC, as luck would have it, we landed a seat at the upstairs bar when a 90 minute wait for a table turned a bit too long. Ryan the bartender became our NYC BFF. He makes the most amazing drinks, is incredibly knowledgeable about the food, and he recommended bars, restaurants and local flavor that basically turned our trip into Ryan's Tour of NY. On that first night we spent about 3 hours chatting it up with Ryan and the other customers. It felt like home right there at the bar and we happily returned for more. Then entire staff is warm, friendly and FUN. The food is comforting, delicious and Oh, the drinks! The drinks are inventive and creative without pretension. I fell in love with the Market Lemonade (with the cutest, sweetest little strawberries) and my boyfriend loved Ryan's Dark and Stormys. Food Highlights: Gazpacho - WOW! If it is on the menu, get it. Creamy, slightly tangy with a kick that is like a surprise birthday party. Amazing flavor combination. Not to be missed. Five Veggie Plate - (does not include the fries) - Who would have thought that 5 different veggies piled together on one plate could taste like making slow sweet Sunday morning love? Pigs Ears - I didn't think I'd want to even try the dog ear treat but I'm so glad we did. It was perfectly crunchy, perfectly piggie, perfectly delectable. No wonder dogs like 's for her famous orgasm scene, she wouldn't have had to fake it. OMG does not even begin to describe it. Creamy, warm, melt in your mouth, and great for feeding to a friend. My only regret is that I never did get the burger.",1

93403,1814,4.0,1,2010-08-14,"Why am I reviewing a place that it seems everybody else on yelp has reviewed? Well, for one thing, I'm under the misguided impression that you really care what I think. But more importantly, I think what really makes this place special is somehow what makes a lot of NY hot spots unspecial: the crowd. This restaurant will pack you in tight and you're suddenly a part of the bachelorette party on your left and the date on your right. And it's GREAT. The cautious and suspicious New York attitude is nowhere on display on the Spotted Pig. Everybody's in a great mood, everybody wants to recommend you their favorite dishes (most people were voting for the gnudi, but my loves were definitely the summer succotash and the fries) and even the waitstaff seems to be in a good mood, despite how busy they must be. Everybody's so damn happy to be at the Spotted Pig, you find you are too, even after the sticker shock of realizing your $14 gazpacho is approximately two shotglasses worth. The price prevents it from being a five star, but for a splurge, the Spotted Pig is a really fun night out. Special note for my fellow veggies: The menu is heavily seasonal, so go here in the summer and not the winter, if you want to have more than one option on the menu.",1

It was certainly great food, but I think the feel of the place is what really makes it stand out. Our waitress was great. Good knowledge of the food and so friendly and fun! The stand outs of my meal were my small plates. I had the deviled eggs - soo good; the Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto was TO DIE FOR; and I actually really enjoyed the Crispy Pig's Ear with Lemon Caper Dressing. The pig's ear came out over a salad. I actually did not eat much of the salad. Shared the pork belly and a burger. They were certainly both delicious and well cooked. The pork belly was great and came over a bed of lentils and lima beans. For me, the lima beans didn't really work but the lentils did. The burger was great, but perhaps It was my stomach getting too full, but it didn't change my world as I was told it would. The shoestring fries were very well seasoned though.",1
126079,1814,3.0,1,2010-08-10,"Just went there tonight with my wife, infant daughter and a couple of NYC friends. Was really looking forward to it as we were in town from SF for the week and i had heard a lot of good things about the place. Arrived around 7:30pm and were promptly accommodated on the upper floor and provided a high chair for the little lady. Table was small and cramped but we weren't bothered; the waitstaff while looking like many of the too-cool-for-school peoples I have encountered in similar popular hipster establishments in SF lacked the attitude and were very pleasant. Given the late hour (for our daughter) we went straight to the entrees and a round of drinx. The salty dog was fine but the market lemonade was really surprisingly good; more tart and berry like than lemonadey. I owned a bar for 5years so I can appreciate an innovative and tasty cocktail. Entree wise we ordered the seared squid and cannelini beans, strip steak, beet salad and seabass with squash. We all appreciated the skill and thought that went into the dishes but were universally disappointed by the portion sizes. Now keep in mind that this group of diners  were not gastronomically retarded out-of-towners expecting to be filled to stuffing until we rolled out of the joint. We have all eaten all over the world at more places than we (or you) could count. The portion sizes are more in line with what one would expect for a medium to large appetizer. We ended up stopping off at a pizza-by-the-slice place on the walk home. Summation: great food, good service, eat before you go.",0

There are no reservations, and the wait time for dinner can be atrocious on any day of the week.  If you show up past 7pm, be prepared to wait at LEAST 1 hour (more likely 2 hours for a party of 4).  The Pig appears to have a much higher ratio of two-top tables, so coming with a party of 2 will help considerably with quicker seating.  If you must ditch the rest of your party for the sake of delicious comfort pub food, so be it.  Another con that comes with the packed house: slow service.  But I could even see how long it took our server to weave through the crowd to get to our table each , sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, and roasted quail.  The burger's roquefort cheese is a bit too salty but I do love the accompanying rosemary shoestring fries! It's not cheap, it's not convenient, but it's certainly delicious!  Is it worth the hype and the exorbitant wait times?  Still undecided.  I would recommend stopping by The Pig first to put your name on the list and give your mobile number, and then head off to one of the many amazing bars in the vicinity to chill at while you wait for a table.  Keep drinking, stay happy, and you will be eating Chef Bloomfield's finest in no time.",1
126080,1814,4.0,1,2010-08-07,"What can I say that hasn't been said about The Spotted Pig?  Yet, here is my story: Went by on a Sunday afternoon after brunch and the S.P. was open, but serving only a limited menu (from 3 PM to 5 PM).  The staff was super friendly and we were welcomed into the restaurant.  Shown to a small table in the corner and seated on little benches (which is kind of an odd thing for an aging man who is 6'4"" and over 250 pounds).   We got the almonds and the olives and an order of the Chicken Liver Toasts to start with.  The almonds were delivered and were standard almond encrusted in a nice salty spice crust; a bit disappointed that they were not the newly trendy Marcona almonds, we nonetheless devoured them and thought, ""Marcona schmarcona!""  The olives were spiced in house and served; too many green olives however (for our tastes).  The chicken liver, though, stole the show.  Nicely cooked and flavoured with a bit of wine/brandy and smeared over the top of a lovely toasted piece of foccacia bread, I would gladly eat this any time.  This would be the way to introduce someone who did not like liver to the ""Offal Club"".  Unfortunately, my friend is not just a member, but a Founder of the Offal Club (like me!) and I could not scam (one of only a few selections on the mid-day, post-brunch menu) and asked the waiter if I ordered it medium-rare if they would really cook it medium-rare.  The waiter responded that they grind their own meat for the burgers and cook it to order, just like a steak!  Woo hoo!  Rare/Medium Rare (a gross conceit, but one I must admit!) for me, medium-well for my friend. When it came out, we looked on the plates in amazement.  A HUGE burger on a toasted bun topped with melted blue cheese.  Nothing fancy - no tomato, no lettuce, no pickle.  I put some Dijon mustard on mine and happily bit into it - and felt myself get dizzy from a Foodgasm.  The French Fries were also a thing of beauty.  Thin, crispy, house-made fries to which, in the final 30 seconds, thin slices of garlic and fresh rosemary had been added to sizzle and finish the fries, then salted and served.  There were a mountain of fries.  No way we could eat them all, no matter how absolutely delicious they were. Of course, we ate every bite on our plates.  Every fry.  Every crumb.  Every fried piece of garlic. If this is how they treat burger and fries, I know that I will be back to sample some more of this food.",1
126081,1814,5.0,1,2010-08-05,"THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER EATEN The Spotted Pig doesn't serve British food. I know because I tasted a lot of flavours that day, but disappointment wasn't amongst them. It's OK, I can say that, I'm British. I grew up disappointed by most things I was forced to stick a fork , all my life I've been a burger lover, on a hunt for the world's greatest burger, but I can finally rest now that I know it exists and it's on the menu at the Spotted Pig. Now I've had good burgers,  even in Britain, but I had never before had anything quite so perfect as that which I tasted that day (roughly a month ago) at this Village Eatery I'd hitherto never heard of. The Upside: Screw the starters. I mean, I remember them being good (I think there was something called a 'Devil on Horseback', a bacon wrapped Date if you can imagine such a thing), but who gives a toss? It's all about the main course, baby. I'm convinced that that burger reached the innermost recesses of my soul and opened my mind to the cosmos. In the flavour I could taste the whole happy life of the cow before it willingly sacrificed itself for my meal - and I was one with that cow. Although no such music was playing, I heard the elaborate guitar-work of Jimmy Hendrix in my mind and I KNEW I would never taste a burger this divine ever again. I openly wept. The Downside: Staff weren't ready with Napkins to mop up my tears of joy. Also, I couldn't get 'Purple Haze' out of my head for , it was a positive experience. There was a friendly atmosphere, the people dining at the tables next to us offered us suggestions and encouragement on what to purchase, and although the staff didn't stand out particularly, they did provide efficient service and were in no way 'bad', so I can't really grumble. The only real con is the price, and that's only if you're not prepared to spend a lot of money. That said, I'll definitely be back, I think this is just about my favourite American restaurant ! -MVB P.S: The fries were OK too.",1

Hmmm. I started off with the deviled egg as recommended by the Food Network.  My expectation was spot on - a deviled egg is a deviled egg.  The one I had was way too salty and at $3 a pop I felt bamboozled.  Next came devils on horseback aka bacon wrapped prunes.  These were delicious.  I could eat them all night, and I would be sooo regular with all that fiber.  For the entree I ordered the chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese.  The burger was cooked perfectly and very juicy.  The roquefort cheese was a bit powerful and salty but complemented the meat and shoestring fries.  But I think that any burger served with bleu or roquefort would have the same issue.  For those not used to these cheeses, be forewarned, they are strong, overpowering, and its flavor lingers in your mouth like  - ok, gotta keep it clean, we are talking about food after all.  Service was great and the staff didn't treat me like some freak who comes and eats alone.  But I wish they hadn't sat me next to the couple who were getting freaky themselves.  All I could hear was slurp slurp and they were done with all their food.

I loved the crunchy bread, though.  People next to us recommended braised pork cheeks but they were sold out.  Great place to go around 2 pm for lunch on a weekday if you don't like crowded places.  Where we sat was called 'side-by-side' table that was a bit awkward for me not facing my husband.  Their burger was so good and well-seasoned, take a bite without ketchup if you are a ketchup lover - trust me, you don't need it.",1
94228,1814,4.0,1,2010-07-29,"I finally headed out to the West Village to try the Spotted Pig's famous Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort cheese. Wondered what the whole buzz was about. It was a Wednesday night right before 7pm, so the bar wasn't crowded yet and there was still seating. Awesome. SERVICE Nice, friendly, unpretentious. Tap water was given in a bottle so that you can self-refill. FOOD Chicken Liver Toast - Flavorful and heavy. I think I like their version better than ABC Kitchen. Char-grilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries - The burger was delicious. I got it medium, and it was nice and juicy. I thought the cheese was a bit too strong and salty for my taste in burgers. The bun held my burger together for the entire time, toasty and fluffy. The shoestrings fries was very crispy. I love crispy fries, but they had some herbs that I wasn't too fond of in ;DR I think I'll try the burger again without cheese if I ever wander into the neighborhood again.",1

126086,1814,5.0,1,2010-07-24,"Truly unique bar and restaurant.  When I ordered the $18 burger, I thought to myself that I must be overpaying at least $10 for the privilege of eating at this very busy bar/restaurant.   The burger didn't include truffles and was not made of kobe beef so why would it cost $18?   The burger arrived with a huge mound of thinly cut french fries.  The buns were perfectly toasted and the only thing on the burger was the blue cheese. No lettuce, tomatoes or pickles to confuse the product. It is not hyperbole when I say that it is probably the best hamburger I've ever eaten.   The meat was tender and perfectly cooked.  Most importantly, it was moist and not greasy.   The blue cheese was flavorful but not overpowering.  It was just a great burger.  Anyone who is not impressed with this burger must provide the name of a restaurant that serves a better burger. The thinly cut fries were also very good.  Last of all, we also ordered the chicken liver toast. If you don't like liver, foie gras or pate, then you're going to hate it.   My friends, who are not adventurous eaters, hated the chicken liver. Thankfully for me, I grew up eating pate, foie gras, liver and onions and all kinds of animal parts and I thought it was very good.  I got to eat most of it by myself. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Some people complain that the food is too expensive and the wait is not worth it. Sure, if you live in NY, you don't want to wait 45 mins to eat an $18 dollar burger every week.  It's probably not worth it. But if you're visiting, it's worth it to hang out at the bar, filled with young attractive people, while you get a table to eat the burger.   Afterwards, walk over to the meat packing district for some great nightlife.",1
49212,1814,3.0,1,2010-07-23,Last night (Thursday) my two friends and i flipped a coin to decide where to get a burger. JG Mellon on the UES or the Spotted Pig in the West Village. As fate was in charge we grabbed a cab and headed to the Pig for one of their trade mark burgers. From memory we arrived at 8pm. Big mistake. The guy at the front told us it would be an hour and half wait. What the?? After downing a few ales at the bar an hour had passed and we were getting hungry and impatient. I decided to try and bribe the door guy. Probably not the best attempt or maybe i should have gone higher than a 20 but at the end of the day its a burger not a lobster or caviar. Finally we were called up stairs and we sat down. The waiter was fairly average but he did manage to get our oysters out to us relatively quickly. These were below average and for the cost ($36 for a dozen) i expected a lot better. We each ordered the burger that came garnished with shredded fries. The burger is amazing soft and full of flavor. They only use a heavy blue cheese and that certainly is enough. My friends on the other hard werent impressed. Does the place have a great burger? yes. Is it worth an hours and a half wait? Hell no. If i was to go back it would be for lunch or on a monday or tuesday night when the crowd dies off.,0

We were standing upstairs in the bar at around 11 on a Tuesday, it was sufficiently crowded and dark.  So when the order arrived, I thought it was seasoned deviled eggs wrapped in bacon but i twas simply the devils on horseback which is prunes wrapped in bacon, seasoned and stewed.  It was the most delicious prunes I've ever had, that being said, I've never had it wrapped in bacon.  We all know anything wrapped in bacon is delicious.",1

The quality of the meat speaks for itself, considering there's no ketchup, lettuce or onion to mask the taste. The shoestring fries are a perfect accoutrement. The other food I've had there is good, but pricey. I'm always disappointed with the size of the appetizers/bar snacks. The wait can get awful.

14518,1814,1.0,1,2010-07-18,"A friend and I came here with pretty high hopes, having heard good things about Spotted Pig. The food was mediocre, and our overall dining experience was atrocious. My friend and I ordered the chicken liver toast, Dutch baby, and Roquefort burger. These were items mentioned on a lot of Yelp reviews I read as well as recommended by the server.   I made the mistake of assuming the chicken liver would come in the form of spreadable pate. Instead, I got chunks and chunks of gritty liver on rather hard bread. The Dutch baby was extremely sweet and not at all substantial. Neither the ingredients nor the amount of effort required to make the dish justified the $15 price. The burger was what I refer to as a ""guy burger"" - with only cheese and meat, no lettuce, onion, tomato, or other condiments. The meat was rather dry, and the Roquefort was too pungent for the burger. The shoestring fries accompanying the burger were probably the best part of the meal - rosemary adds great flavor to potatoes. The food was overpriced and disappointing. The brunch food was on par with mediocre sports bars that nobody raves about, so I really don't understand the hype. To elaborate on the ""atrocious service,"" my friend and I arrived at around 2:30pm. There was no wait to get seated. We ordered pretty quickly. After a while, we noticed that people in the three tables next to us had gotten their food already, although they arrived after we did and ordered the same items. The same servers were serving all four tables within a tiny 5 ft seating area but somehow did not notice that we were the only ones without our food and did not come to offer any explanation or reassurance. We finally flagged them down, and the waiter came back and muttered an unapologetic explanation we did not understand. I only made out the words ""kitchen"" and ""mistake."" Ten minutes later, our food arrived. When we requested the check, the manager came out and offered a very belated apology. The burger was comped, but the gesture offered very little consolation after the poor overall experience.",0

By the time we were ready to have dinner we were pretty full off of fries and beer so we split a burger and a side of broccoli with bacon. The burger is really rich, in fact we both didn't finish our halves.  It was also a bit too salty and I'm a proponent for high sodium diets!  The broccoli and bacon literally melted in my mouth and had a little kick to it. It was so freakin' good.",1

15927,1814,4.0,1,2010-06-28,"Brunch at the Spotted Pig is something you surely should not miss. It's a little pricey for brunch, but is it worth it? The answer is a resounding yes. Let me first put it out there right now. The chicken liver on toast is probably one of the best deals in the city. $5.50 for two pieces of warm, unctuous bread piled high with warm, highly seasoned chicken liver ecstasy. The initial thought may revolt some of you, but set aside those antiquated and preconceived notions because this is little traditional Jewish dish is euphoria in your mouth! Folks rave about the deviled eggs here (tasty as they are) but they don't hold a candle compared to the chicken liver. Sorry! My eggs Benedict were standard and nothing to rave home about. However, my partner's burger was very good. The meat had good char that kept up with the strength of the blue cheese nicely. The huge mounds of shoe string fries were delicious too. A perfect bloody Mary made with pepper infused vodka with pickled veg on a toothpick rounded off an excellent meal. Service is the most impressive thing about Spotted Pig. It looks loose and disheveled, but really behind that hipster facade is a humming machine that does an excellent job with very little attitude. Best of all, it's surprisingly spacious inside with two levels of seating so a long wait is probably not in the cards. Sweet.",1

To be fair I am only judging based on the burger I had and chicken liver toast. Not that I had a lot of chicken liver toast in the past, but it was ok. The burger was a quality burger, but I could not get past the cheese. I am sure some people love the uniqueness and very potent flavor. For me it was way too overwhelming.

After a year of being in the city, I finally made it out to try it because a friend from California was in town visiting and he'd been told he should make it a point to go try their burger. It was a beautiful Friday afternoon and we stopped in for a later lunch and got seated right away. The service was great and the ambiance was jovial with several surprisingly large parties for the size of the space but I think when it came to the burger my friend and I who are both not shy eaters were surprised at how salty the blue cheese actually was. We're familiar with burgers that feature strong cheeses (like the Father's Office burger in LA) but this one struck me as slightly off-balance.

We dropped in with no reservation on an overcast, muggy early afternoon and had a couple of pints and a burger - what a treat!

59564,1814,4.0,1,2010-06-16,"When our entrees arrived, my jaw hit the floor. My frittata was a good size and the homefries were fine, but the burger came with a Mount Everest side of shoestrings. Literally, the fries were piled five inches or so up on the plate. I told the waiter he was not kidding when he warned me. My frittata was extrememly tasty and the home fries were very different in a positive light. They were cooked in a reduction type of sauce or glaze. Worth $7? Probably, but I do wish I had listened to the waiter because we had way too much food. Nikki said the burger was good, but Roquefort cheese is very salty and she had slight meal regret and wishes she had tried another brunch item. Next time, of course, because we both enjoyed our time at The Pig and look forward to another meal there. I did not opt for dessert, as we were sure we would see something while walking through the Village. There are quite a few brunch items. Eggs cooked a variety of ways, cornbeef hash, oysters, duck egg, French toast and a grilled cheese are a few. In addition to the deviled eggs, you can order chicken liver toast, a pot of pickes and a few other appetizers. The prices are mid-range. The burger was $17 and the frittata was $15, not including the $7 homefries. The Spotted Pig is well known and you may have a wait if you arrive during prime time, especially during dinner. It is worth the wait though and you can give you name and cell number and the hosts will call you when a table is ready. Tour the West Village while you wait. They have maps! Another plus about the Village is you might run into a familiar face while you are walking around. Many celebrities live in the Village and I would imagine feel more comfortable walking around there than somewhere like Midtown. We saw Alan Rickman on our way to The Pig. ~Alex",1

We waited the requisite 30 minutes (told it would be ""an hour and 10 minutes"", always a nice surprise when they're early) down the street at Turks and Frogs, got the call on the cell, and were seated promptly. The atmosphere is great: lively, fun, friendly. Not pretentious, despite having earned a spot as a destination restaurant. We split asparagus with prosciutto to start, which was good but not really special, then I had the fowl and my friend had the stuffed pigs ear, after much hearty encouragement from yours truly (I secretly just wanted to try it without having to commit to the whole dish). The fowl was good, but extremely over-salted. I ate it, don't get me wrong, but the amount of salt was impressive. The pig's ear was good, not really exotic, reminding me more of thanksgiving stuffing than anything else. I wasn't blown away, but I can see the appeal of this place: I will definitely go back, and definitely order different stuff and sample the menu , the dining ""experience"" (the staff, the space, the music) was so pleasant that I'm more than willing to give it another go.",0

The cod was decent, save the sauce as well as the greens.  It was beyond salty.   Make sure you ask for a few extra caraffes of water because you will definitely need it.  They should rename the restaurant The Salty Pig.  Pure disappointment, two hours, two bills and complete lack of satisfaction.",0

23798,1814,4.0,1,2010-05-31,"I am of two minds---and stomachs---when it comes to The Spotted Pig.  Having had two very different experiences at this Mario Batali joint, I've concluded that I mostly (read: 96%) love this spot. My first visit here was with a group of friends for NYE 2010.  After 3 rounds of a drink called The Ginger Bush, which consists of ginger beer and whiskey and is a variation of the Dark & Stormy (ginger beer and dark rum), we were seated by the main window near the entrance.  Our server, a friendly chap in a fedora (we correctly guessed that he was a jazz musician), gave us generous free samples of their celery bisque (heavenly) and then recommended that we try their foie gras appetizer.  We ended up having two rounds of THAT (and two more after the meal).  The burger, which is what I was most excited about, managed to skip my usually detailed scrutiny,  thanks to the several Ginger Bushes I'd already imbibed by the time the food arrived.  All I remember is that it was 'pretty good'. Upon visiting a little over a week ago---in continuation of our search for The Best Burger in NYC, which, honestly, is really just a race for #2 since there's no beating Minetta Tavern's Black Label wonder of the world---the burger finally came under due scrutiny. The Boy loved it.  Currently, it's his #2.  He found the rosemary-seasoned fries to be in perfect complement to the Roquefort burger, which was cooked exactly as he wanted it, was juicy, and, though slightly overpowered by the cheese and not much assisted by the somewhat stale (or dry?) bun, presently remains second in overall standing.  His ""Oink"" rating?  4 out of 5. I have not yet decided where their burger stands.  I generally agree with The Boy's assessment, but  really, really, really hated the bun.  It was, in my opinion, too thick, too dry, and simply not in keeping with the overall quality of the rest of the burger.  But maybe it's supposed to be that way, in order to counteract the juiciness of the meat. As it stands, this place generally rocks.  Good brews on tap, great atmosphere and service, and overall excellent food.  Burger, your ranking is, at present, TBD.",1

Bartender was awesome, letting me taste wines before I chose one, and set me up for dinner at the bar. I had a special Soft Shell Crab appetizer, it was heavenly, cooked perfectly, and amazing sauce. I then had the Sheeps Ricotta Gnudi, and it is as good as everyone says- loved the crispy sage leaves on top, I also had the peas for veg, and even that was amazing. I hope to go back with freinds so we can order more, and try it all.  If you are considering it, by all means go!  Almost everyone around me seemed to be eating the burger, so it must be great.",1

67250,1814,3.0,1,2010-05-13,"The day started off in a dreary, rainy overcast, which, if Hollywood and my high school English teachers are to be trusted, is a sign of foreboding and rarely a good thing. If you follow almost any kind of food news, you've heard about Spotted Pig. It's one of the few Michelin Guide restaurants that is not French-based cuisine, and it regularly makes most lists of (relatively) affordable must-have eats. We started off our lunch with deviled eggs and chicken liver toast. The deviled eggs had a vinegary(?) tang to it that isn't really to my preferences. The chicken liver was very yummy in my tummy. It was thickly spread on the toast, just the way that I like it. In fact - it was almost as thick as the toast - perfect! I had had had to order their infamous burger. It's right up there on the list with Minetta Tavern's Black Label and a long string of other ""to-do musts."" The buns are specially made for Spotted Pig, and the meat patties are a hidden secret. I very much enjoyed my burger patty - it was the perfect blend of tenderness and juiciness, all pink in the center the way that I like it. The burger comes fairly naked - sans lettuce, tomato, and every other addition that you might expect with the exception of some Roquefort cheese. Now, I'm a fan of most cheese. Really! I promise that I am! But when you take a bite with too much of the cheese, it has a sharp, salty punch to your taste buds. Too much of this kind of cheese makes me make a face when I eat it - and I mean a weirder face than normal. No me gusta. I split my burger with one of my friends and don't know if I could have finished a whole one with all of that cheese. The burger comes with a huge pile of shoestring fries, which were fab if you like to eat slowly. It's hard to grab a huge pile of them because they're so skinny. To be honest, about a half of the way through my half of the burger, I decided to make it up Cali style and stuck a small handful in the rest of my burger. So much better that way. Overall, Spotted Pig was decent, but not , I was expecting my mind to have been blown clear across the country. I'd like to go back for dinner and try the gnudi that one of my friends completely raves about. (They don't offer it for lunch.)

56184,1814,3.0,1,2010-05-09,"Burgers from heaven, that was what I was expecting when I arrived at The Spotted Pig for lunch with two lovely ladies.  I have heard so much about these burgers from all over and it was one of the two burgers I want to try most on my list, right behind The Black Label Burger from Minetta Tavern.  As soon as they sat us down, I pretty much disregarded the menu.  That was how focused I was on the burgers.   Burgers, burgers, , I ordered some Deviled Eggs while my dining partners ordered the Chicken Liver Toast. Deviled Eggs:  Each order comes with two halves.  The egg white was nice and soft but the egg yolk could have been fluffier and lighter. There was a light smattering of vinegar mixed with herbs that gives it a unnecessary sour taste. I had better deviled eggs at Dinosaur BBQ at half the price. Burgers, burgers, :  The chicken liver spread was simply very rich, thick, and tasty.  This was generously placed on top of a nicely toasted thick bread cut into two pieces. Burger, burgers,  Medium rare with a nice thick pink center when I bit into it.  The burger consists of a big piece of beef patty topped with Roquefort Cheese sandwiched between a specially made deliciously soft hamburger bun.  No tomatoes,pickles, or lettuce to be found anywhere.  Not that a good burger needs them. I had a problem with consistency of how the burger tasted from bite to bite.  The Roquefort is a very cloying, powerfully sharp tasting cheese.  It enhances the flavor of the beef when spread thinly on the patty making the burger delicious.  A problem arises though when there are uneven giant clumps of the cheese spread throughout the burger.  These parts with too much cheese was overly strong sharp/sour tasting.  Too bad because if it was done right throughout, it would have been a burger that I would have enjoyed immensely. Instead it was a love/hate relationship with my taste buds depending on the bite at the time. The burgers came with a heaping half a plateful of delicious shoestring fries.  Fried with bits of rosemary and garlic, and lightly salted, they were great.  They have to be the skinniest shoestring fries I've seen anywhere.

The Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings $ 17 was delish, had it more seasoning would've been a 5 star. The cheese helped improve the flavor.

We called ahead and were told there was no wait. As soon as we got there, we were pushed aside so that the arrogant host (who looked like he hadn't showered in days) could seat his friends. We waited at the bar for 15- 20 minutes and were seated upstairs near the bar. The atmosphere was awful. It was just a bunch of underage completely drunk college students falling all over each other. There had to be hundreds of them. Our waitress disappeared to bar tend half way through the evening. The staff is also just a bunch of clueless college kids who have no idea what they're doing. Our second waiter was more concerned with picking up some drunk girl at the bar then waiting on us. We ordered the ""famous"" hamburger. NOT impressed. To be honest, I think I had a better burger at shake shack. The burger was flavorless and dry, had a tiny bit of cheap blue cheese melted on top, the fries were overly salted and had some burnt rosemary sprinkled on them. Don't waste your time here.

The sandwich was perfectly delicious as it was and I found myself savoring every bite. My fiance doesn't eat cheese so he had no option really but to go for the Burger. The lunch menu is big on cheese. He obviously ordered his san Roquefort and had it cooked medium. He described it as 'not quite as good as Minetta, not a patch on Five Guys but very good nonetheless'. It comes with shoestring fries. He thought they were ok but I wasn't a fan. They looked fantastic and the little bits of rosemary and garlic are a nice addition but there's just a whole lot of string and not much else.

The meat was just amazing and juicy and you could tell it wasn't your avg burger patty.  The cheese added a great touch, though don't get it if you don't like Rocquefort because the cheese can be overwhelming (it wasn't in my opinion though).  It's just a shame that this burger doesn't come with the option of other cheeses. - The gnudi was good but I don't think it deserves all the hype its been getting, the deviled eggs were good, but nothing special.

The tongue was cooked in such a way that you could scarcely tell that it was tongue.  It tasted like a marbled steak: had melt-in-your-mouth feel and tasted very beefy (yeah, that's not a real word but work with me here) and a brightness thanks to the condiments.  Again, you can taste the spring flavors. Shoestring (but not the best fries I've had).  Wished that the rosemary and salt was more evenly distributed but we seriously could not stop pecking at this dish.   The service was good, timely,   I have to say, hats off to April Bloomfield.  You may not be a ""some pig!""",1

126098,1814,3.0,1,2010-04-07,"The Spotted Pig managed to put a spot on its reputation in my books. Let's begin with the good stuff. 1) The beer selection is impressive and delicious. I adore the Speckled Hen and the Brooklyn dark beer, whichever name it goes by. The bar people are very courteous and have many suggestions handy. 2) The food at dinnertime is inspired and one can see a lot of thought going into it. The burger patty on the Roquefort burger is thick and delicious, I'd be surprised if it weren't top quality meat ground for the occasion. The shoestring fries are a show-stopper and create an instant addiction. 3) The servers are lively, polite and unpretentious. There's a personal touch to it that redeems some of the defects I will enumerate below for both Spotted Pig owners and patrons alike. Now, the sore spots. a) Inspiration, fame and a ""gastropub"" designation do not justify serving three thin slabs of grilled polenta and cheese on greens and charging anything in excess of 10 dollars for it. I understand the concept of profit and cost, but someone please have some moderation. b) The difference between late lunch menu and dinner menu befuddles me. Although at dinnertime the Spotted Pig boasts some masterpieces (the bass, the octopus, the burger just to name the few I tried), the late lunch menu looks like some lazy oaf in the kitchen can't be bothered to cook anything worthy of effort. Burger: easy; chowder: re-heat and bingo; oysters: easy; et cetera.  The Spotted Pig has some dishes it is famous for, yet the little cross next to the gnudi was nowhere to be seen. Either serve a decent variety of food throughout the day or stop serving late lunch altogether. The menu with the little crosses almost screams ""ha! Drink until 5.30 pm, you non-yuppie!"". c) Speaking about 5.30 pm. I can hardly fathom what difference 30 minutes make for the kitchen to suddenly be able to churn out the whole dinner menu as opposed to the late lunch one. It is even harder to understand the lack of seating during the 5-5.30 pm limbo. If I'm going to wait and drink (which is exactly the purpose of such interruptions) I'd rather do it at my table rather than perched on a stool feeling like a macaw. d) The shoestring fries have the potential to be absolutely delicious. Preparation of said side must, however, take into account that a thin fry will need a lot less salt and definitely a lot less rosemary to taste good. When I detect the same taste in the fry and the fried rosemary bush I know some balance is lacking. e) Seafood begs delicate flavors if it's fresh and strong ones if it's old, cheap or done badly. The chowder is spicy. I am a pepperhead myself, yet I beg of the Spotted Pig not to ruin what is undoubtedly a delicious soup with spices and strong flavors. Maybe every seafood being spicy is a North American fad. I don't dig it. Conclusion: In the evening it seems a yuppie-infested gastropub that tries hard to pluck its goose-patron's feathers with the least amount of hissing and the greatest amount of smiling. With trendy wine glasses setting you back $14 (beer is for plumbers, anyone?) you'll need a corporate card to get a buzz or fill your stomach on anything other than a good burger. Between lunchtime and dinnertime it slides into laziness and what looks like carelessness. The limited late lunch menu makes one feel one's eating leftovers and the chef's gone for a hike. Maybe that is the case, in which eventuality the place should have some pride and just not serve the late lunch menu: let those who are hungry and not working a 9-to-5 find other harbors. Maybe the Spotted Pig is a victim of its own success and is indulging in excesses. If I were Gordon Ramsay I'd say they need a rocket up their bum. With so many delicious treats in NYC and so many great beers in the East Village (or the Blind Tiger in the Pig's backyard) I hardly see a reason for another trek down Bleecker and West 11th street. I will be back only by a guest's request or if I see a change for less pretention, lower prices, more consistency in the menus and some old-fashioned common sense. Sorry.",0
49246,1814,4.0,1,2010-04-05,"So I've kinda been on a burger fixe as of late, having recently indulged in the burgers at both Minetta Tavern and Red Betty's. And so I decided to continue this trend and check out The Spotted Pig one late afternoon when I knew there wouldn't be a wait. I had no preconceived notions of their burger, other than it having won acclaim from many New Yorkers. And so I posted up at the empty bar and ordered an Old Speckled Hen and their burger. Much to my surprise the burger is presented on an over flowing plate of shoestring fries*, seared bun and no additional fixings or condiments (there is ketchup and mustard available, but I wanted to try this burger in its untouched form). There is a blue cheese spread on the burger however, so I was quite intrigued to dive in. And it happened to be an excellent burger that was grilled to perfection. The blue cheese was very tasty and offered an interesting spin. However it wasn't as evenly distributed across the burger patty as I might have liked, so there were a few intense bites interceded with more calm and beef-only bites. I could have remedied the situation easily enough myself, but I was feeling lazy. And no matter, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and the burger all the same. It was also nice to have visited on a quite weekday afternoon, which allowed me to enjoy my book, a beer and a burger at the bar without the atmosphere being too crowded and stimulating. *I despise shoe string fries. I tried picking at them, but gave up after 10 or 15 minutes.",1

Cost: -$60/head (tax and tip included) Atmosphere/Decor: -No reservations so plan accordingly. -Cozy, bustling, and comfortable pub/tavern atmosphere, but seating was bit cramped.   -Good to see a bar on each floor. Ordered: 1. Sheep's ricotta gnudi with brown butter & sage: Cheese and butter - how can you go wrong? 2. Codfish balls (special): Tasty with an appropriate amount of breading, but portions were a bit small. 3. Buffalo mozerella with freshly baked rye (special): Whilst buffalo mozerella is cheap and plentiful in most of Europe, it's the opposite here.  Nonetheless, the moment I heard it was offered, I had to order and I wasn't disappointed!  That the rye was fresh and tasty was an added bonus. 4. Grilled beef tongue with duck fat potatoes and pIckled beets: I liked it, but didn't love it, and ordered it more because it's hard to find.  The potatoes melted in my mouth and wished they offered it as a regular side. 5. Chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese & shoestrings fries: Only had a bite of the burger, but my friend claimed it was one of the best (and more expensive) burgers he's had.  The shoestring fries were truly ""shoestring"" in nature, which was pretty cool. 6. Goat entree (special): Again, only had a bite, but my friend quite liked it. 7. Beer!  A moderate selection of craft beers on tap and in bottle that were a bit overpriced at $8-12/bottle or pint. Service: -Friendly, playful, and enthusiastic staff.  Perfect match for the setting. Conclusion: -Every dish seemed to explode with flavour in its own way, and coupled with the bustling atmosphere and great service, it made for a very enjoyable dining experience.",1

The gnudi was one of the best things I've ever eaten, next time I go I will order a full serving for myself! The burger was good but I'm not a HUGE fan of blue cheese so the flavor was a little overwhelming for me. My husband was here for a work dinner on a different night and had the pork belly which he highly recommended. The wine selection was also very good. We stayed for some extra drinks after our meal in the bar area, it had really filled up, by 9pm it was packed on a Monday night! And it's in such a great location, the West Village is my favorite Manhattan neighborhood. I loved the relaxed yet cool vibe and can't wait to check out the brunch.. only disappointment was no celeb spottings!",1
21464,1814,3.0,1,2010-04-05,"Came here for brunch a month ago on Saturday with three friends thinking that we would have to wait. To our pleasant surprise, there was none (thanks to the mad rain!).   From the get-go, it seemed everything was going to be just perfect. The service was warm and welcoming, the decor, what's not to love?  It was all about fine comfort. The first floor (where we ate) was furnished with a balance of traditional hybrid booths and not so traditional stool seating.  The adorable Old English, plaid decor and quirky pig accents were definite crowd pleasers.   But then came the purpose of the visit, the food.  Unfortunately, it was a hit or miss: -Deviled Egg- overpowering vinegar taste, love it or hate it. -Liver-not my thang but seemed good for my friend. -Spinach Frittata- thumbs up for the balance of cheese and spinach and the generous portion. -French Toast- felt more like dessert since there was too much syrup (not a fan). -Salad- Bleep?? Forgot the name of the salad, but the greens were so sparse compared to the dressing/filling.  I don't recommend it as a meal unless you eat like Kate Moss. -Chargrilled burger with shoestring fries- delicious (also if you don't mind gorgonzola type of cheese) and huge, probably the most bang for your buck.   Even though I loved the charm of the place, the service and my burger, I am not sure if I'm sold on Spotted Pig's 'fine comfort' food. Plus, if you tell me, $25 plus for brunch seems a bit pricey (mind you, that was my fare for the burger and soda).  3.5 in my book.",0

All the servers were West-Village hipsters, fully adorned with tattoos.  I could see how bobos- bourgeouis bohemians- would find this place cool and accordingly, skew/bias more stars than it deserves in their reviews.  The food, however, is only pretty good.  Not great.",0

19128,1814,4.0,1,2010-03-28,"The Spotted Pig was great.  I arrived at 7 on a Saturday night and put in my name for three people.  About an hour later, I got a call telling me that my table was ready and when I arrived, I was indeed seated promptly.  (It's surprising how often this is not the case at busy restaurants.)   The atmosphere was very active and cozy, but my table, and most other tables I saw, were intelligently placed out of the way of some of the chaos, so we were probably secluded and not bothered by the masses of people about.  Young, cool, but not obnoxiously pretentious. To start, we had marinated olives and marinated mozzarella (two separate dishes).  These were both excellent.  The olives didn't have that extremely pungent vinegary flavor which is frequently off-putting.  It maintained a nuanced true olive flavor.  And the mozzarella was just amazing.  But there was a downside to that dish, which I'll get to later.  I had beef tongue with duck fat potatoes and pickled beets.  (There were also cornichons on the plate.)  It was an incredibly well-balanced dish.  The richness of the tongue, potatoes, and sauce were expertly countered by the other tart elements.  And the tongue was really well cooked, I loved the texture.  My friends both had the burger, which they seemed to really enjoy.  I had some of their fries.  They were excellent.  The thyme really put them over the top, I couldn't get enough. Service was attentive, charming, and respectful.  Couldn't ask for much more in this regard. So why just four stars?  A few reasons.  The mozzarella dish, a special, was $16.  It included four small mozzarella balls with bread and a little salad.  Portion-wise, it much more closely resembled the ""bar"" dishes, most of which were in the $5-10 range.  Because it was a special, we basically had to guess how expensive it was.  This was an unwelcome surprise.  Also, the beer is ridiculously marked up.  A bottle of Pacifico is $7, and most decent beers are $8-10.  This is a bit ridiculous.  Lastly, and this isn't really something that can be controlled, but to an extent Spotted Pig is a victim of its own popularity.  You really have to plan ahead or be patient to eat here because of the omnipresent wait times.  Despite these things, I really enjoyed my meal at Spotted Pig.",1

Needless to say we decided against the burger and took advantage of their comped meal. We tried the tomato soup / clam chowder / chicken liver toast / grilled onions - everything was WAY too salty.

We drank at the upstairs bar while we waited, which was nice, b/c they have a nice selection of beers and drinks. But the real treat came when we got our table and were able to eat! We ordered the pot of pickles, deviled eggs and gnudi to start. The pot of pickles , but the deviled eggs were very good, a little lemony. The gnudi! Ah, well, like others have said, it is fantastic! You will dream about these! The textures and flavors are so wonderful! We also ordered the burger, the chowder and the stuffed pig's ear (a special). Those were all pretty good, but very salty. It was difficult to finish the shoestring fries and the chowder b/c of the salt level. For dessert, we has the creme caramel and the hazelnut ice cream. Oh, yum!

The chicken liver toast is probably my favorite. The deviled eggs are pretty amazing too and so is the pork belly. Cool beer selection too. There's something about this place that is really special.

27489,1814,3.0,1,2010-03-01,"On a snow-laden Friday night, we arrived at 6:45PM and were told 45 minute wait time. Skipped to White Horse Tavern next door, blissfully unpacked, and passed the time. Walking in it was all faces and darkness and the sensation of entering someone's dinner party. In other words, this restaurant screams homey-ness. We had to wait another 5 minutes before we were taken upstairs to an even more intimate space where conversation hummed and waiters could be seen rushing to and fro carrying mysterious creations on white platters. Some of the spaces were very romantic. VERY romantic. Great place for a fourth date. If there is a definition for nook and cranny, this is it. Our waiter was slightly stoned. I did not expect the Spotted Pig to be so bohemian and yet it also very Montana mountain cabin meets Brooklyn Heights. Our waiter lolled his eyes, swung his hips and fidgeted while answering our menu questions. One question I had was if the dishes I wanted had dairy, because I do not eat dairy. (I know what you're thinking, why are you in this restaurant??) Anyway, I finally picked the Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms with Duck Egg & Pine Nuts. I am not a French/British food connoisseur but when I see the word ""Hen"" I take it to mean there is some kind of poultry in the dish. I also ordered some rosemary shoestring fries and my companion ordered the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage. My dish comes, and I pick at it, trying to figure out in the dark lighting if the striated black structure on my plate was the sinewy proteins of a chicken shoulder. I tentatively took a bite: it was a mushroom. Mystified, I look again at the duck egg and could not bear the suspense any longer. I called my stoned waiter over and asked if this was the roasted hen dish. He said yes. I pointed to the duck egg and said ""but this is an egg."" He looked momentarily confused and then after re-reading the menu clarified the issue for me: the Hen of the Woods Mushroom is to be read together as one phrase. Hen of the Woods is an adjective, not a noun, and most definitely not chicken. Fooled! I felt scammed. The rosemary shoestring fries were yummy when hot, limp when cold. The roasted Brussels sprouts were fine but way too buttery for me. And the Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms? Drenched in balsamic vinegar. The Spotted Pig is great for lovers of butter and sophisticated European cuisine but not for a simpleton like me.",0

No. Did I really enjoy the service (at the bar or at the table) supplied by those with inexplicably-sprouted hair and -located piercings? No. Did I love the food? Unequivocally yes. Had a drink at the bar during our estimated 40-minute wait for Sunday Brunch (felt like and possibly was ~25 minutes). Enjoyed a Spotted Pig Bitter And a Captain Lawrence while admiring surrounding fine swine. Once seated and the menu investigation commenced, the vegetation outside kept my attention for a significant portion of time and delayed said exploration. Eventually opted for the delived eggs, Artichoke Salad, Half A Frittata, the Ginger Cake And a Piece Of the Flourless Chocolate cake--everything was legen-wait for , the ""eclectic"" tunes were bumpin' as the ubiquitous grilled cheeses stared at me with ""ha ha"" eyes (nowhere near as good as grilled cheese bedroom eyes). Overall, The Spotted Pig provides a refreshingly egalitarian approach to good food and drink despite cramped quarters with faux big shots (ourselves not excluded). The correlation between bearded help and renowned eateries is a relationship that needs to be investigated (as well as the aloofness therein). Make no mistake, Dutch Babies will not escape my grasp next time.",1
126109,1814,4.0,1,2010-02-21,"There are not a few restaurants in this city that I haven't tried, merely due to worry that the experience could never live up to the hype. And I hate crowds. I also tend to be nervous about these ""no reservations"" places (I am sick of this trend, BTW), envisioning 2hr+ waits and snooty hostesses. So we went at 5:30 on a Friday, were coldly greeted by Devendra Banhart at the door, and promptly seated in a cozy, dark corner room on the 2nd floor next to a C-list celebrity and his date. So far, everything was meeting my expectations. We started with the ""Devils on Horseback"" and and chicken liver toast; the former as delicious as almost anything (but especially prunes) wrapped in bacon would be, the latter onsisting of crispy, thick slices of rustic toast slathered with gobs of Madeira-laced liver pate. Next was a half dozen oysters (appropriately evocative of the ocean), and the ricotta gnudi (good, but what's the hype?). Now, I had heard (and eaten plenty) of calf's tongue, but beef tongue? I was prepared for it to be gamey, gristley, so you can imagine my delight when presented with two neat slices of delicately flavored, tender meat, napped with creme fraiche and pickled beet slices. This is definitely the chef to trust when delving into the eating of scary bits. And this burger everyone is raving about? Wow. It was as lovely as everyone says: juicy, rare, smothered in Roquefort and nestled next to a tangle of rosemary-scented shoestring fries. A few bones to pick: they had run out of the house bitter, which seems like a serious lack of foresight for 5:30 on a Friday night. Secondly, it struck how much snootier the staff was than the celebrities surrounding me at this place? What gives? The waitress almost refused to give us recommendations, saying that people's tastes differ. Um, really? No way! She eventually warmed up, but it put a damper on the first third of our evening for sure. Al in all, its nice to see a place that lives up to the hype.",1

49141,1814,3.0,1,2010-02-17,"After hearing all the hype about The Spotted Pig I felt the need to check it out. It was also a good change from the pretentious restaurants I've been going to latley (, Philippe, Nello's etc.). The Spotted Pig is a very trendy low-key pub that's a mix of a hipster hang-out and a place to people watch. The place is always crowded and since they don't take reservations, getting a table can be a bit difficult. With investors such as Jay-Z & Mario Batali its no wonder the place is so popular. Since Jay-Z bought the building where The Spotted Pig is, they've added an upstairs bar and dining room so this has somewhat helped the large crowds overflowing onto the sidewalks. April Bloomfield is the head chef and the menu consists of Italian & English fused dishes. For lunch the menu isn't really anything to rave about. The Spotted Pig serves their 2 staple dishes (Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi and the Burger with Roquefort Cheese) and basically that's all everyone in the restaurant orders. I saw perhaps one person order the Cubano Sandwich and everyone else either had the Gnudi or the Burger. The whole restaurant is very ""hipster"" from the waiters in Ray-Bands and plaid shirts to the water served in wine bottles and the brown paper over the table cloths. The food however is very gourmet. As an appetizer I had the special of the day which were Duck Eggs with a salad in a vinaigrette and bacon. The dish was good, nothing mind blowing, the saltiness of the bacon went well with the duck eggs and the contrast between the dressing and the saltiness of the bacon was a nice touch. The Burger is served with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries. The cheese's sharp flavor actually went well with the large burger and so did the mountain of Shoestring fries. The gnudi, essentially a ricotta dumpling, was very rich and you could tell the ingredients, such as the sheep ricotta, were fresh. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was a slab of rich chocolate fudge that was a bit too heavy to have all by myself, but if you share it the dish is just fine. While I did enjoy my lunch at The Spotted Pig I do feel the place is a bit overrated. The menu has 2 hits and the rest sort of goes under the radar with most diners. If I were in the area I'd return, but if I was told the wait was longer than 45 minutes I don't think the wait would be worth it.",0

Go early for a table or make a reservation. It's rare to find a seat but I ended up going on one of the coldest nights of the year and was therefore seated upon arrival (I'd been there before and the wait was 3 !). Definitely order one of their exclusive beers. Have a few drinks, take in the scene, schmooze, then go for dinner somewhere else - there are tons of cute bistros in the area. The burger is definitely worth trying IF YOU LIKE gorgonzola. Otherwise, either ask for the burger without cheese (it's perfectly seasoned and performs well on its own!) or order the gnuti instead. Keep in mind that my bill - after one burger and two beers - came to around $40.",1

We also started a tab at the bar and the tender told us we had to close the tab out becuase he was ending his shift soon. Way to earn a tip buddy! The only thing that keeps me from lowering the stars is the food. Tasty but easily forgotten.",0
37950,1814,5.0,1,2010-01-28,"I generally have scorn for no reservations restaurants in New York City. Because I am not a 80 year old who enjoys eating dinner at 5PM nor am I cool enough to be out at 11PM on a school night. So when the suggestion of Spotted Pig on MLK came up, I was disdainful. We grabbed a few beers at the nearby White Horse Tavern while making bets on college basketball via our smartphones like the degenerate gamblers we are and surprisingly enough, the hour wait flew by. The reservationist called my boyfriend promptly at one hour later and said ""We have a table open for 's a pretty romantic spot. Are you a couple or just friends?""  I sort of loved that she asked us this. We took the romantic seat which wasn' really romantic given you're squished next to other diners on either side of you but at this point, we were famished. Deviled eggs were an OBV choice as was the chicken liver toast. The eggs were tasty but paled in comparison to the creamy and decadent chicken liver toast. Heaped with delicious chicken innards, this is the stuff culinary dreams are made of.  Even my nonadventurous eater of a boyfriend declared this was the best (well, only) chicken liver toast he had ever consumed. We shared the famous Roquefort burger with shoe string fries and we decided to order a side of kale for our greens. Fortunately for me, the kale was drenched in bacon fat. Fine by me. The burger was interesting - from a meat perspective, it was perfectly juicy and flavorful. I did find the Roquefort to be a tad overpowering at times. Spotted Pig, despite your clunky interior and no reservation policy, you (and the chicken liver toast) will always have a fond place in my heart. Like a good friends with benefits, I will keep coming back.",1

The host was very kind, even though the place was packed and offered to call us when a table became available. We checked out the neighborhood while sloshing through the snow. I must be rolling grandma status because the lighting in this place was soooo dark :/ I understand it adds to the ambiance, but I've never been to a more dimly lit place. [just an observation, not a complaint]. Anyhoo, I had the ""Pan Roasted Skate with Chicory, Potatoes & Capers Sauce"". The fish was flaky in a lovely sauce. But I'd have to say, the most memorable aspect of this restaurant were two things: The service was interesting. Our hipster waiter never smiled or laughed. He just kinda starred at us. He would appear, stare and then disappear. Weird? The other patrons served as our evening entertainment. We were seated with these young kids on a date to my left having a conversation where they were obviously trying to impress each other with the biggest words they knew. And to our right was a pair of guys that kept talking about Yelp. I've never been to a restaurant where the ""Yelp"" was constantly dropped! ""I hear about this place on Yelp."" ""Do you use Yelp?"" ""I read on Yelp the gnudi is what this place is known for"". Fun times!",1

While waiting for our table (they do not take reservations, which I have mixed feelings about), my compadres and I marveled at the height of our bartender. She's a watchtower all to herself! This is a helpful beacon when one is navigating their way through a packed upstairs trying to get to the bar. The food was seasonal and honestly prepared - I was wishing it wasn't January as I ordered since this meant lots of braising and starches. I found the food a little greasy and salty for my taste, but well done by an impartial measure. Good service, good wine list, and overall a good time.",1

I've been to SP on nights when I thought the people were amazing - authentic, fun, wordly, and not pretentious. I've been there other days and it looked like the Rusty Knot's prepsters threw up inside of it. So I'm tending to believe it is hit or miss. Like most everything in West Village that is popular or trendy or owned by a celebrity - avoid it on the weekend, go only on weekdays.  Unless you head for brunch - which can be great on the weekend. Steer clear of a Friday or Saturday during key going out hours and you will hopefully avoid all those fun characters sporting boat shoes and dropping Ivy League bomb left and right.",1

Got a nice little table off the bar area. As for the food everything I read about was spot on. we started with the deviled eggs that were very tasty. Then I saw a special on the mirror board that just caught my eye. Pigs ears over endive with capers and lemon. I had to try and it was well worth the 15 bucks! Deep fried is something I stay away from but hey once in awhile will not kill you!  I ordered the burger and the wife the gnudi, we split each and I honestly can't say if I liiked one better than the other. They both were that good! And the shoestrings that came with the burger were very tasty with rosemary. Had a side of kale and bacon, kale was cooked to perfection and very tender. Come to think of it everything was cooked to our liking, medium rare for the burger was perfect! Finished off the meal with a homemade vanilla ice cream with toasted almonds, that was on the special board. Very Good!! They have a nice little wine list with a good Italian selection, we ended up getting the La Mozza I Perazzi Morellino di Scansano 2006, at a very resonable price. It was a great wine we have had before and complimented everything we had. Service was very good, waitress very friendly. Overall a very good meal and fun night out!",1

Everything was soaked in fat, and tasted just like it (but in an oddly non-flavorful way; imagine chugging a bottle of canola oil). The ricotta gnudi WERE very good. The ""devils on horseback"" (bacon-wrapped prunes), pork belly faggot, chicken liver toast, bacon and kale, and a few other dishes besides were just disappointing. I understand that April's restaurants are a ""celebration of fat"", but my boyfriend and I had stomachaches for a day afterwards.

But, it went by pretty quickly. We had four seats by the column near the bar and a few drinks in hand. We were a little bit away from the bar crowd, which got a little out of control in terms of size. Once seated, we realized they had sold out of a bunch of things already. A few of the items that were ordered were the Head Cheese, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms with Fried Egg, and Gnudi which were all amazing. And, yes, everything is pretty salty here, but it actually works pretty well. Then, for entrees, we ordered the Beef Tongue (awesome), the Pork Belly, and the Skate. For dessert, we got the Ginger Cake and Flourless Chocolate Cake. Every single one of our dishes were exquisite, very tasty, and complex. We loved it! Next time gotta try the Burgers!",1
126120,1814,4.0,1,2010-01-12,"On my journeys of trying to find the most perfect NYC burger, I occasionally stumbled upon Spotted Pig's burger. After seeing how perfect it looked, I knew I had to try it. I also read how good it was too, so I definitely needed to try it - and that I did. My friend and I stopped by prior to dinner starting, so it was surprisingly empty to what I expected. I personally was expecting a long wait, due to all the reviews I read and the notoriety this restaurant has. We were told to go upstairs to the bar, and that we did. We looked at the beer menu and quickly picked Old Speckled Hen Ale, which was delicious. Good beer gets a plus from me. The atmosphere here reminds me of an old dark restaurant, which is probably what  it is supposed to do. The clientele was mixed, I honestly felt a bit too young and hip for the place, but it didn't really bother us. We were there for one thing, the burger. The waitstaff was really attentive as well. Sitting at the bar, a gentlemen told us that our table was ready, then while waiting at the table around 3 people in a span of ten minutes asked us if we needed any water or specials. Some of the specials did sound good, but we had our heart set on that burger. We ordered the Spotted Pig burger, which has roquefort cheese, and a pile of shoestring fries on the side. I have been weary of shoestring fries since my first visit at Stand, but these are very good. The burger itself, was so picturesque - that bun, the ratio - it was great. I was ready to be overwhelmed by the saltiness, but for me personally it wasn't bad - the cheese probably makes it so. I definitely paced myself and enjoyed every ounce of the meal. It wasn't really filling - but very satisfying. I'm definitely coming back for that burger. After sitting around wondering what our next step was going to be, we decided to try our hand at dessert. I've heard of this magical banoffe pie, but I did not see it on the menu, nor was it mentioned until our server said ""The seasonal tart is a banoffe"" - my eyes lit up and I ordered that right away. This was my thought process upon eating the banoffe. ""Best. Dessert. Ever. So. Good. Don't Want It To End"" - it was a foodgasm. I wish I could've ordered the whole pie itself, it was so heavenly. I hope to run into it again. The Spotted Pig has a great burger, probably the prettiest in New York City. The banoffe is probably one of the best desserts I've tasted in my life. This all makes me want to go back for more, but next time I want to try those deviled eggs and be more adventurous.",1
126121,1814,4.0,1,2010-01-11,"I'd heard about this place from various food blogs but when I saw that the menu had Deviled Eggs on it, I knew I had to taste them.  Deviled Eggs are something on my ""Must Try"" list.  In any case, taking heed of the warnings about crowds and long waits, I decided to come here late since the kitchen doesn't close until 2am.  I got here around 11:30pm on a bitterly cold Sunday evening (27 degrees F) aiming to avoid the crowds and I had my pick of tables and zero wait  The low tables and stool (albeit cushioned) seating took me by surprise but it was either sit on the stools or the rather high banquet bench for the low table so I made do and opted for the stool:  No big deal if the food is good. As per my uploaded photos of each dish, the Deviled Eggs were nicely garnished but I didn't taste anything but the eggs.  Some places have too much vinegar in it so you don't know if the eggs just went bad or whether its too much vinegar but here you just couldn't taste much of anything except egg.  Where was the zing from the chilli peppers/flakes that I'd heard of?  I couldn't taste it.  Neither could I taste any vinegar but that's a plus.  So that was a bit disappointing since Deviled Eggs normally send a shiver down my spine--here, there was no shiver, more like ""meh"".  On the other hand, I liked the Sweetbreads.  Unlike other places which cook them all the way through, here it was crispy on the outside with a somewhat soft center.  The Devils on Horseback (prunes stuffed with maybe pear chunks and wrapped in bacon) weren't quite what I'd normally go for--a little war was being fought between the sweet and the savory in one dish.  The Chicken Liver Toast was a scrumptious throwback to my early years dining on Chicken Liver Paté on toast.  To anybody who has ever had that, this is a freshly-made recreation.  The Pork Belly Faggot was basically a stuffed cabbage shell with caul fat wrapped around pork belly and vegetable chunks.  Very delicious but heavy and a meal for a cold season like the Winter we're undergoing right now.  Perfect.  The side dish, Beets and Greens would've been great except for the salt content--they overdid the salt so much that even I, a salt lover, was overwhelmed.  It was like trying to eat a dish of solid salt where the occasional taste of a sweet beetroot peeked through occasionally.  This could've been a magnificent side dish if they'd just eased off on the salt somewhat. There are gastropubs and there are gastropubs but just for the food alone, I'd come back. That they also have Belgian Lambic ales is icing on the cake for me.  Pity they only have Framboise and no other flavor (there's more than Framboise, Peche and Kriek).  It'll just have to be late though, as I don't like waiting nor having too many neighbors:  11:30pm was just the ticket to evade the crowds.  But maybe just after 10pm would've been workable also.",1

It was suppose to have some chili in it but they were just way to sweet and on the very mushy side. I din't really enjoy that. I didn't feel adventurous or in the mood to try there wide array of different dishes so i did choose the burger which was definitely worth it. The reason for a lower rating was the huge wait for a table [minimum 1 hour] and the lack of space to stand while waiting.,0

84062,1814,2.0,1,2010-01-03,"I don't think I'll be returning here. I went on a bitterly cold Saturday night upon request from out-of-town friends who were visiting - I generally don't like to wait so I'd avoided this place previously, but I'd always heard good things so I was down to hang out at the bar for two hours while we waited for a table. As it turned out, waiting at the bar turned out to be the best part of the evening. It was crowded - ""bustling"" might be a nicer way to put it - but an attractive crowd made for good people watching, and the bartender was excellent. The cask beer I started off with wasn't to my liking, but the dirty martinis made with kalamata olives are both aesthetically pleasing and delicious. When we finally were seated, the table of Italian men next to us wouldn't leave us alone, which did not add to the experience. We ordered some appetizers: the deviled eggs were swimming in way too much olive oil, but the chicken liver on toast was good. Then our burgers came. Whoa, salt. I like me some salt, but this was just too much. It drowned out the flavor of the beef. I ended up dowsing my burger in ketchup to get a little sweet to balance it out, which probably shouldn't need to be done at someplace that charges $17 for a burger. The fries were also disappointing, flavored nicely but too thin. I didn't feel like I was eating potatoes at all. My friend's gnudi, on the other hand, was amazing, but she was disappointed with the somewhat small portion since it was all she was eating. Our waitress was pretty much MIA throughout our meal, but she was pleasant and it was busy, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.

I even called to make sure they were open, but they were closed. I was HUNGRY. They were setting up tables when we got there and were quickly seated in a corner booth on the 2nd floor. The place quickly filled up. I love all of the pig decor. It took a while for us to get our food. I got the burger. In retrospect I should've gotten it cooked medium rather than medium rare. I think it was too early in the day for medium rare and for the cheese. The Roquefort is good, but I was having a lame morning. The fries were delicious. I tried a bit of my friend's Cubano which was also good, but not amazing. I spied my neighbor's Dutch Baby which didn't look like it would beat Walker Brother's in Chicagoland. My all-time fave.",1

I ordered the burger, which was probably the best I've ever had, and the shoestring fries were light, crisp, and simply phenomenal. My boyfriend devoured his pork belly, but I'm not a big pork eater, so I'll just have to take him at his word that it was pretty damned tasty. The service was distracted but fine. I like the feel of the place in general, but on that particular night we were sandwiched in between two large parties, one loud and obnoxious, and the other a party of 5 seated too close for comfort at a tiny table for 2.

93476,1814,4.0,1,2009-12-29,"More like The Salted Pig! We didn't have anything to do last night and were looking for a good burger.  We came across The Spotted Pig which I've always been interested in but have never gone because of the no reservation policy and long wait time.  I actually didn't mind it because I got to get drunk beforehand instead of after.  They have a few good selections on tap but I had to try the Spotted Pig Bitter Ale which is served at room temperature.  We were seated before I finished my second drink so I guess it wasn't so bad. We decided to get Buffalo Mozzarrella Antipasto with Prosciutto to start with.  It is served with toast and is great when you try to get them all in one bite.  It was a little salty but you would expect that with this type of dish.   We both ordered the Chargrilled Burger but made a a crucial mistake of asking for more cheese.  It turns out that they use roquefort cheese which is very salty.  The Burger was almost perfect except for our mistake.  It is served with a big pile of shoestring fries which gives it a nice touch.  Once again, a little salty but I guess it was my fault.  It was nothing a few beers couldn't wash down though.

21344,1814,2.0,1,2009-12-26,"Quite honestly, I know see why the fuss is about.  Maybe it's because April Bloomfield has become a rising star in the male dominated culinary arena.  I think this joint is better for hanging out, versus actually dining but maybe I'm just not so hot on the Gastropubs.  The place is REALLY noisy (almost like you need to shout to your neighbor across the way) on a Sunday night, which again makes it better for a bar scene vs. food. As for the bar snacks, I would say the Chicken Liver Toast was jamming-- seems that Bloomfield is good with this kind of whipped delight/bread combo (a la her Onion and Bone Marrow Soup at the Breslin), and the Deviled Eggs were good. Let's just say that I expected a way better overall dining experience for such a long wait.  Protip: come at 4:30 to sign up for the earliest dinner spot, and come no more than 4 people max- the wait time is still 30 minutes or so.   Anyway, I did enjoy the ambiance and the decor.  The atmosphere is grungy-- still trendy but sort of like an upscale hipster place.  The waiters are waltzing around in Def Leopard T shirts and they suck.  (It's true, baaad service. Our waiter was impatient with us, and didn't even bother to ask if we wanted dessert- hmpfh). Okay, so the best item seems to be the Burger. I know I'm sort of cheating in this Yelp review because *I* don't eat red meat, but I'll admit it looked pretty damn good.   The shoe string fries were way better on paper than in person though- they were so thin, it felt like  I had the chorizo stuffed quail which was 1) a teeeeny tiny portion and 2) gross.  The chorizo was gritty and flavorless- and the quail had NO meat, just the bone!   It's also ridiculous to charge $17 for most of the salads, but that's just me. I've heard it's a better place for brunch.  When the desserts better than the dinner, you know it's a bad place.

So needless to say, we quickly took advantage of what could only have been a lapse in their judgment when they agreed to have dinner at a place so blatantly tied to pork, nervously hoping that they would not be relegated to an evening of salads and bland soups. Although they could not share in the wonders of calf liver, sweetbreads and pork belly faggot with us, the sheep's ricotta gnudi was surprisingly sumptuous and the sweet onion tart a pleasant, well executed treat.  I was actually very pleased by the large portion presented when we ordered the plate of five vegetables (found under ""sides""), which was satisfying in both quantity and flavor (full disclosure: I had to pick out 3 or 4 small, errant pieces of pork for them - but hey, how do you think they made it taste so good?) So in the end, my friend and I left feeling both satisfied to have indulged so heartily in meat products, but to have been able to share this evening with two vegetarians who are dear to our hearts.  And yes, I think we owe them an evening out to Zen Palate the next time ",0

As to (b), it turns out every other Yelper had the exact same experience.  Well, listen closely, it's an amazing dish, so just try it (and pretend it was your own idea).  Luckily, everything else was great: quail, dessert, wine.   As to the wait?  They also serve dinner at the bar and at ""the column,"" which while they may not be as comfy as the banquettes, are often open and allow you to just drop in and eat without having to get seated after a 2 hour wait.",1

My friends and I agreed - we loved the service.  We wanted to take it slow and easy, especially since it was our friend's birthday.  Our server was attentive but not pushy and did not rush us.  The food was perfectly timed and our drink/wine glasses were never empty. Of course, I had the burger as my main - to this day, I still think the Spotted Pig has the best burger.  I think they should try serving it with sauteed onions, !  :) I started my meal with the lentil salad which was not really a 'healthy' salad - but a mixture of greens with cooked lentils and some creme fraiche (I think).  Whatever it was, it was REALLY darn good.  I would have licked the plate if I had to. I got my bf an order of the 5 side vegetables which were great.  Especially the kale w/ bacon. Then again, anything is great with bacon. (*sigh*) As a bday cake/dessert, we ordered the banoffee pie.  The server earned 5 more stars by adding a candle to the pie for us - THANK YOU!  That was very thoughtful of him.  Anyway, the banoffee pie was PERFECTLY sweet and gooey.  The wrong banoffee pie can get WAY too sweet and decadent.  This was done juuuuuuuust , i wonder why bakeries in NY don't do banoffee pies?  It really is a GREAT pie.   All in all, a successful meal and great times at the Spotted Pig.  There's a reason why this place gets so crowded. ;)",1

The Spotted Pig didn't live up to my expectations, and recommendations from friends makes me doubt their taste. To each their own.

Who goes to TSP for a salad? He had the bacon hash and poached egg, It , in our opinion.

Good selection of beer and my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy the burger -- tho he did say it wasnt the best he had ever had.  I always make fun of him for using a fork and knife for his burgers but it seemed appropriate at this joint!  The fries were also addicting!  I made sure I got a taste of them before he cleaned his plate. I myself enjoyed an octopus salad.  I love octopus and this was one of the best salads I have had incorporating it.  We left very happy.  The place was lively and yet we were still able to enjoy our meal at a tiny table for two.,1

My buddies and I all ordered the burger.  Without a doubt, the best burger I have ever had.  Perfectly portioned between meat and bun.  The bun was toasted and fresh.  The meat incredibly flavored and impeccably cooked to medium rare as ordered.  The shoestring potatoes were definitely noteworthy two, sprinkled a little heavily with rosemary, but paired perfectly with the burger.",1

The Spotted Pig Bitter was quite good.  I also enjoyed the great chicken liver toast that I shared with my friend.  That was the first time we went there that weekend. After the theater, dinner, and a little sightseeing on the Sunday of that weekend, we decided to go to The Spotted Pig so I could get myself a T-shirt and, well, to eat there again.  We got the chicken liver toast again.  I got the Bath Chap, which is like a patty of braised pork, breaded and fried.  Served with it was a little salad and chanterelles.  I also got the poached duck egg with lamb tongue and flageolets.  Both dishes were executed wonderfully and had great seasoning and balance as well.  I can't say enough good things about the offal I had there.  Likewise, the braised pork was wonderfully tender and moist.

126135,1814,3.0,1,2009-11-10,"Dear Spotted Pig, I came early and expected the wait. It was only 45 minute, not bad, but gave me time to stroll around. When we came back new arrivals were reporting a 90 minute way around 7! The front of house was kind enough to remember my face and let me know that there were a few tables finishing up their meal and that they have received their tabs. A nice plus. We were seated in probably one of the SMALLEST tables I've dined at but no bother, I cam for the food. An order of the chicken liver toast, burger, and roasted pork belly and we're on our way. Chicken Liver Toast: It was like a very greasy pate. Surprisingly reminded me of some asian flavors, the toast was nice and crunchy, very accommodating to the chicken liver. Flavor was strong, and stays in your mouth, I couldn't imagine eating more then 1/2 the toast which was just enough for my appetite. Roasted Pork Belly: The bean puree served with this dish was DELICIOUS. The roasted pork belly was cooked fantastically as the skin was crispy, and the meat (what there was of it) and fat was a mouthful of flavors. Almost a bit too much flavor, and I kind of felt guilty as I was mostly consuming some flavorsome fat and skin with a side of meat. Despite the flavors and cooking, I figured I could get comparable and cheaper pork from a chinese BBQ joint taken home to eat. Hamburger: The meat was tender and cooked prefectly. The gruyere was very flavorful reminiscent of a bleu cheese. The fries, were more like potatoe chips and nice to snack on. I would've preferred more potatoes in the fries but it was decent. Overall a nice experience, I don't know if it was worth the money that I spent but if you're looking for peppier brittish pub food, give the spotted pig a try. -Ed",0

I went last night (Sunday) with my sister, showed up at 6, and we were seated by 7, so the wait wasn't too bad. We had already decided on the chicken liver toast, the ricotta gnudi, and a burger to share. Well, they were OUT of the chicken liver toast, so we couldn't even order , to which he responded, ""the ham hocks are good."" I kept waiting for him to give more suggestionS, but no, he didn't. We asked him for some time to talk it over, and went with the poached duck egg with lamb tongue & flageolet beans. Also when I tried to order a beer on tap, the waiter told me their kegs were broken and I should order a bottled beer instead. At least he was honest and informative, but seriously? If you're a restaurant that's known for its chicken liver toast and special beers on tap, and they're ! So the food came, and I just wasn't impressed. The gnudi was decent, but when you fry balls of cheese, it's hard to NOT be decent. I found the gnudi to be kind of bland, especially after having amazing ricotta at Locanda Verde earlier in the weekend. The poached duck egg with lamb tongue was pretty good, probably the highlight of the meal. The lamb tongue was really, really salty, however, tasted like it was overseasoned, but great texture. Now the burger -- it's just a toasted bun with a hamburger patty and a little bit of cheese in it. I didn't even think to ask for other toppings, but after reading other reviews, I guess it wouldn't have mattered because I would have been denied (or they would have been out of onions and tomatoes). The burger was very juicy, and it was good, but just kind of boring. Caveat: I personally prefer my burgers In-n-Out or Shake Shack style - the more toppings the better - but to each his own. The shoestring fries were great though. I could have eaten those all , I'm not really sure how they achieved one michelin , but I don't think I'll be going back.",0

25817,1814,4.0,1,2009-10-27,"I can't even begin to describe how much I've wanted to try the Gnudi here ever since I heard about them a few years ago. I used to stare at the photos online and wonder what they tasted like, cursing the fact that the Spotted Pig was on the complete opposite side of the country and I didn't have much of a reason to venture out that way anymore. But I vowed that I would get to try them one day and try them I did on my recent trip to NY. And were they as good as I imagined them to be? They were. They were so so good I'm almost sad that I actually got to try it since now that I really know how good they taste, the distance between CA and the Spotted Pig seems farther than ever. We flew in late and didn't even get to our hotel till past midnight but we were so famished and knowing the bar was going to be open till 2 , we ventured out with visions of Gnudi dancing in our heads (OK, my head, I don't think my bf had any idea what I was going on and on about). The Spotted Pig was still very busy when we got there but seeing how it was fairly late to be dining, we were seated quickly and service was prompt. We ordered the Pot of Pickles, Chicken Liver Toast, Poached Duck Egg with Lamb's Tongue and Flageolet Beans, the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter and Sage (of course!), and the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries. I adore Pickles so getting them was a no-brainer. I definitely did like them although they were very tart and vinegary, almost mouth puckeringly so. I liked the variety of the different vegetables that came in the pot and happily crunched away on almost all of it by myself. The Chicken Liver Toast had an earthy taste that is characteristic of liver and a slight sweetness to it which I assumed was from a fortified wine they must have added to the mixture. It was a great little bite to start the meal off with and left me looking forward to everything else. The Lamb Tongue was also delicious, slightly gamey with a tang from mustard in the sauce, paired really well with creamy beans and a poached duck egg which the buttery yolk just oozed out of. The quality of the meat in the Burger was good too, very tender and juicy and the bun had a slight crispness from the char. But in all honesty, I'd have to say it was really really salty. I thought it was from the cheese so I scraped it off but the patty itself was too salty, almost to a point that it was difficult to finish. The shoestring fries with fried garlic chips and rosemary were fabulous though. Crispy and savory, you sort of caught yourself picking out the garlic chips to munch on and dabbing at the fried rosemary leaves with your fingers to get every last piece. And the Gnudi? I'm not sure any description would do the tenderest little balls of pure cheesy buttery goodness any justice. But I will say that they were every bit as delicious as I imagined they would be and at this moment as I type this it is taking every ounce of willpower I have to refrain myself from searching airfare to NY just so I can go back and have them again. This spot was a great place to start off our trip at and set the tone for the rest of the weekend- lots of good food and lots of fun.",1

I looooved Piknik growing up, and Spotted Pig's fries took me back to happy days. Everyone raved about the chicken liver toast here, so I hesitantly tried it, not being a fan of anything liver. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Two honking pieces of toast covered in a peppery spread of liver and what must've been six sticks of butter.

126139,1814,1.0,1,2009-10-15,"My buddies and I have been on a burger quest to find the ultimate burger in NYC and after several failed attempts @ getting a table @ the severely packed Spotted Pig, we decided to endure the wait last Saturday. Time it took for a table? 3 HOURS!!!! We were basically starving since minute 1- so imagine just how torturous this was for our belly's. More often than not.. when a person is , another tray of S-pigs burgers came out from the kitchen to tease by giving us a quick whiff. Each time we wanted to give up and leave - another tray came out to suck us back in.. it was pure hell. As we waited we invested into what seemed to be a very promising burger by drinking pints of waaaay overpriced beer (9 bucks a pint!). But this was a SMALL price to pay if the burger tasted as good as it looked. By hour 3 our table was ready- walked through the hordes of people and sat upstairs in the corner. Ordered 2 burgers- Cod- Pork belly-Chicken liver toast- toasted Almonds and Olives. Almonds and Olives came first - Olives were very tasteless and a total rip off $4.50 for 7-9 olives! Almonds however were SOOO dam salty! This tiny bowl was the size of a half dollar and probably held about 20-25 almonds- Three grown men needed 3 glasses of water EACH to wash down the saltiness of the nuts. If we weren't so dam hungry we woulda stopped eating it at nut 1. Next came the chicken liver toast.. which wasnt bad but again overly salty.. hmm 'salty' seems to be a recurring theme here at Spotted Pig. We were overjoyed when our entrees arrived- we looked at each other and nodded- almost as to say: YAY WE MADE IT! *TEAR* I manhandled my burger with both hands as i'd do a ginormous ! Screamed throughout my head - agonizingly, spine cringing SALTY! FUCK ME this burger is SALTY! So SALTY my tongue shriveled up on contact like a dick that has to fuck Rachael Ray. My hunger induced frenzied chewing began to ?!  In denial I swallowed my first bite..Only to take another but not before I drank another half glass of water to properly clear my palate. Second bite was actually worse than the first! I know that Roquefort cheese is salty and all but this is just ridiculous- the cheese curds were completely loaded on the burger. By this time I simply could not tolerate another bite of the burger- my tongue was numb. Maybe the fries would be a bit different? You want some fries with that salt? Good luck trying to get these shoestrings in your mouth, they hook on your face and get all messy.. think octopus on face. Its a good thing we ordered an additional entree I thought to myself- the Pork belly sure did look fabulous. The pork was nice and tender upon the first bite but dare I try the skin? Yes please! My salt induced tongue rash flared up like the 4th of July- If my tongue could talk it would've said ""Feeck eeuuu!"" Ever heard of the tactic where amusement parks overly salt their food so that more drinks are consumed to make revenue? Well you have your prime example here at Spotted Pig- to the extreme. Overpriced, Over hyped, Over the top Salty. Oh no. Game Over.",0

9911,1814,1.0,1,2009-10-05,"To put it delicately, the food I ordered for lunch was caustic.  Very caustic.  Chicken liver on toast?  Some liver taste. Gooey and really salty.  The toast points were okay, but they really didn't add anything except to act as a plate for the liver. My Roquefort burger and shoestrings?  Awful.  First, the meat is shaped like a perfectly made hockey puck.  Second, I ordered well done and I got medium. To top it off, I waited at least twenty to thirty minutes for it, and got it after a couple had received their burgers when they ordered ten minutes after me. Third, again, it was caustic.  Very salty.  In fact the meat was only there to support all the salt they put on the burger. Fourth & fifth, the Roquefort had some blue-ey taste but was really salty. When I asked if I could get tomato and onion for my burger, the waiter told me ""no"", the tomato and onion isn't available for the hamburgers.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Is this from the chef's pretension? Or some fantasy that tomato and onion will affect the delicate balance between the harmonious  rapture of the ground beef and roquefort cheese? Maybe the chef is scared the onion and tomatoes will over power the salt?  Thank G-d I was allowed ketchup.  Actually, now that I think about it, maybe the chef and/or management is a Reagan Conservative.  As in ""Ketchup is a Fucking Vegetable!""  How about them shoestrings?  Well, they're certainly stringy.  You taste some garlic and rosemary but there's a even heavier taste to them.  I bet you can guess what I'm going to say. I will say that the French press coffee is good.  And 1/2 of the staff I encountered seemed professional.  However, it's not enough for me to give a second star.  My advice is if you want good chopped liver go to Sammy's Romanian.  If you want a good Roquefort burger and fries, and you're willing to travel, then maybe Alchemy on 5th Avenue by Bergen Street  in Brooklyn.",0

We had: Deviled eggs. Chicken liver toast. Sardines. Burgers (x2) The eggs were quite good, though not my absolute favorite deviled eggs -- I'd rate those at Centro Vinoteca a bit higher.  The chicken liver toast was to die for, and well worth the wait alone.  The sardines, also very good -- a very generous portion for a ""plate"" (and not a main), I believe six sardines.  Excellent to share, and really quite good. The burgers were also very, very good.  Neither my wife nor I are particular fans of shoestring fries, but these were tasty with the roasted garlic bits and rosemary sprigs, until (as always with shoestring fries) they got cold.  I wish for a true, hearty 'chip' rather than the shoestrings, but it is what it is.

126144,1814,4.0,1,2009-09-28,"Okay, so I went here last week for my birthday dinner, and it was our first time! We arrived at the host stand at 8:20pm on an unseasonably warm Wed night and were told that it would be an hour wait.  Not to be disuaded on my b-day, we put our name in for a table, and tried to squeeze our way back out through the front pass, almost getting bumped into by a few people including a tube-topped woman who paused at the front step for about 10 secs, exclaiming, ""O I think I've been here before.  ...I think I've eaten here before!""  Which, of course, befuddled me that anyone could a) NOT remember if they'd actually gone to the Spotted Pig or not b/c it's an absolute ZOO of people swathed in a red-lit glow standing amidst kitschy little fat piggy figurines draped in gold necklaces that litter the entirety of the restaurant like some kind of Satanic temple with cult members washed in sacrificial pig's blood, practicing pig idolatry!, b) NOT have intentially made the trek / endured the wait / fretted about the wait  to eat at the Spotted Pig the last time they dined here or this current instance, c) NOT have had some sort of time-transcendant culinary awakening / revelation(s) impressed upon them after having dined at the Spotted Pig enough to remember it!   No, I wasn't mad at ""tube-top woman,"" -- just very, very, veeeeery confused.  It was amusing. So, I remembered this cute little book store that's across the street from Magnolia Bakery called the Biography Book Shop.  After a nice long stroll around the West Village, we decided to head over there @8:45pm to spend a little time.  I've always seen this place whilst spooning heapfuls of that THUPER Banana Pudding from Magnolia into my happy mouth, --but I'd never visited.  Well, it's a FANTASTIC book shop!!  My bf and I spent a little change here before we were called back to the Spotted Pig (2 short blocks down the street) at around 9:20pm. Once we were sat upstairs, we were relieved to see that there was a bit more breathing room than the tiny, squashed-together tables and the awkwardly-positioned seated diners downstairs.  We were placed in a bit of a nook, and the structure of the room was so angled off into different nooks and rooms that it was difficult to see the arrangement of the rest of the tables, but, in general, there seemed to be a bit more open space and a bit more space between parties / tables from what we were able to see from our vantage point.  Our square 2-top table was small but comfortable, and it also appeared to be much more substantial looking than the round 2-tops downstairs.  The party of 3 next to us were sat at two HUGE 2-tops pushed together. Then I looked over to my left and saw that ""tube-top woman,"" who had arrived at the Spotted Pig AFTER US whilst pondering her Spotted Pig deja vu, --had actually been sat at a table with her party BEFORE US!!!  Then I looked across the table to see who she was talking to in her party and saw that it was Lance Bass.   Bravo, Lance Bass, , he looked a bit doughy, but I guess if he's gained the majority of weight from a healthy Spotted Pig obsession, then I can't fault him for that, and may actually change my opinion of him from indifference to mild respect. However, it was annoying to see that they had been sat before any of the rest of us simply b/c he'd been in N'Sync a decade ago -- and especially since it was my birthday dinner, dammit!   Anyway, I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time here -- so just be prepared to be pushed aside, no matter how much you're filled with good cheer when you arrive, b/c they will most likely find a way to show you that you are not as special as some former popstar, actress, etc.  It was just not what I was expecting at this place since they were known to be strict with their ""no reservation"" policy -- I thought they were trying to preserve the interests of the commonors like David Chang tries.  But, oh well.  I guess you can just shrug it off if you want to try this place, like we did, and enjoy the local book shop, neighborhood, etc, while waiting for a table. The deviled eggs and the chicken toast were great -- I'm sure nothing more needs to be said about them.  The calamari salad w/cilantro butter and roasted fennel came with deep-fried chickpeas and bits of pancetta -- and it was our FAVORITE!! The not-so-great items were the Gnudi (which was WAY too salty, even though I'm a salt FIEND) like they hadn't refreshed their heavily seasoned pasta-water in a VERY long time and nobody bothered to take the time to check it.  Also, the Haddock chowder which was overly salty as well -- like the line cook had accidentally forgotten about it and our portion had been reducing on the burner forever into a salt chowder w/smoked fish, , s/he didn't taste it at some critical point.  Tsk, tsk, tsk..

76582,1814,5.0,1,2009-09-28,"You walk in and it feels like just another packed after hours pub. People squeeze in around the bar like pigs around a trough, squealing to get the bartender's attention for another pint. It's dark, it's noisy, and its hastily decorated with swine trinkets. Those who get seats at a table are on stools bumped around by rushed wait staff and intoxicated customers trying to make their way to the bathroom. This may not sound appealing, but the uncomfortable, messy, and unrefined atmosphere works as a surprisingly pleasing foil to the world class food they serve. Palates which are accustomed to experiencing such refined food in equally refined dining environments are therefore in for a taste enhancing contrast of the senses. On the one hand, your eyes and ears subconsciously tell your mouth and nose, based on the decor and ambiance, to expect mediocre food. However, once your taste buds and olfactory nerves get to experiencing the food, it becomes one wonderfully confusing and lovely combination of seemingly contradictory sensory perceptions.

Speaking of spirits, the drinks at The Spotted Pig are also heavenly.  Their homemade brew, served at room temperature, is good and unique.  The other specialty cocktails are just as well made and worth a try. These drinks serve one of the best bar scenes in Manhattan.  Always busy, the two bars of the restaurant attract locals, tourists, and celebs, creating a vibe better than some of NY's best clubs.   At the Spotted Pig, the 'glamor factor' has been turned down a few notches, but that is not minded by its patrons as it creates its own glamor in the fun and kitschy decor that covers every corner of the space.  One feels as if they are in a distant and cozy farmhouse turned gatropub - one that turns the laws of gravity and pigs upside down.",1

12862,1814,1.0,1,2009-09-11,"There is an old saying, ""Don't cast your pearls before swine.""  Allow me to update it:  ""Don't waste your money at the Spotted Pig."" On the occasion of my 400th review, I am going to highlight the worst Michelin-starred restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  I arrived alone early on a week night, and the hostess explained that if I wanted a table, the wait would be over an hour, but I could just eat at the bar, and she recommended the bar upstairs since it would be a bit quieter.   Said bar had 9 seats with all of them occupied.  Unfortunately there was very little area to stand.  All of the tables were taken, and people were clamoring around with their drinks.  Food runners were passing by me about every minute or so.  I constantly had to keep moving to one side or another.  20 minutes passed.  At this point, I decided to just stick it out.  I figured someone would finish their drinks and I could finally take a place at the bar, but that was not going to happen anytime soon.  Other people started to arrive, and were deciding whether to wait it out too.   Most left, but after 50 minutes, a group of 3 came and decided to wait.  I am pretty certain they wanted to jump in front of me since three of the people were getting ready to leave, but my patience was exhausted and I wasn't about to allow it.  I finally got a seat after 63 minutes.  I should have just put my name on the list.  Observation #1:  Michelin starred restaurants normally take reservations, for good reason.  Observation #2:  For a Michelin-starred restaurant, this place is unique since the majority of the business was focused on drinking beer, with no less than 3 bars in the place.   Time to eat.  The newly seated group was given their menu first and ordered first.  I then had to ask for a menu for myself.  The place is very popular for their hamburger and fries, which does not sound like a very difficult dish to prepare culinarily.  I opted for something more interesting, the crispy pork belly served with bean puree and a small selection of greens.   To drink, I had their house specialty, the Spotted Pig bitter.  The beer was very light, but otherwise was okay.  The pork belly was just terrible.  Fried, greasy, lacking in flavor.  How could something so naturally delicious be transformed into a heavy mound of blandness?  It was so bad, I actually had to force myself to finish it.  Keep in mind that pork belly is the savory equivalent of ice cream, and like ice cream no one ever has trouble finishing it.  Not to be outdone, the greens were worse.  I couldn't identify what they were.  I also couldn't identify the antiseptic aftertaste they left in my mouth.  Was that bleach?  Honestly, I am asking.  Now the bean puree was tasty.  Unfortunately it is almost a cliche now to serve a pureed accompaniment next to a major protein -- a staid choice to be sure.  And the presentation was just boring.  It was the sort of dinner I would expect to have at a place like Applebee's.   Ambience.  The patrons and staff were consistently interesting but I say that ironically.  One of the gentlemen sitting at the bar offered me his hamburger and fries since he didn't want it.  I refused.  Then one of the servers dropped a tray of glasses at the bar which resulted in flying shards of glass departing in nearly every direction.  Another gentlemen sitting right next to me leaned in to get my attention, and warned me that one of the shards hit him and that I should be careful that there wasn't any broken glass that may have landed in my food.  Have I mentioned that this was a Michelin-starred restaurant?  Then one one of the patrons was finishing a night of standing up and drinking and decided to lean in over me while I was eating to pay her bill.  This culminated with her actually throwing the pen she used to sign the bill right over my shoulder, hitting me in the process.  Indeed, this was a very classy establishment.  The entire time it was so loud and distracting, a moment of culinary pleasure in a charming restaurant was just not going to be had here.   I was asked by the bartender how I liked everything.  I responded that I didn't like my dinner at all.  She said I should have said something sooner so that they could have taken the dish off of my bill.  She was very nice about it.  But I wasn't looking for a free meal, I was interested in evaluating their food.  And in my opinion, you have exactly one chance to get it right.  She did take the drink off of my bill which was a nice gesture.     Overall, this venue is just a popular bar that serves a supposedly decent hamburger.  If you want to eat anything else or you think that this place is in anyway more special than that due to all of the accolades it has received, you will be sorely disappointed.  But this is why Yelp is useful.  I can tell you about my very bad experience so that you will know better and not be taken in by the hype.",0

The food on the menu read very 't quite sure what I was getting myself into, but I'm glad I took the plunge.  I would definitely recommend the Scallops with corn pudding as a must!  The sauce they were sauteed in was to die for, and the corn pudding was creamed corn with a delicious crust on  A few other memorable menu items were the beets (don't remember what the dish was formally called), the succotash, and the brushetta with goat cheese and red pepper.  We started with Deviled eggs and they were such a good idea to whet the , it was a bit expensive.  I wouldn't recommend ordering wine as it is severely overpriced.  The restaurant is also very quaint (crowded) and since it has turned into a hot spot, it was packed and LOUD...Not a place for romance.

Chicken Liver Toast was so rich and the toast was just right to spread that yummy goodness all over. I had Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi which was so creamy and buttery and I even loved the burger - which is huge because I am not much of a roquefort cheese fan. It was so hard to keep my hands away from the shoe string fries and I had to mentally tell myself that it's not my dish over and over again.

8023,1814,5.0,1,2009-08-16,"After seeing The Spotted Pig in Food & Wine, GQ and Conde Nast Traveler I decided to go there last night. The Spotted Pig does not take reservations. I called around 6:30 pm to see how long the wait was and a gentleman advised it was an hour to an hour and a half. I called again around 7:15 pm and the wait was down to around 45 minutes. When I got to The Spotted Pig and gave the host my name I was told to expect to wait for 45 minutes. My girlfriend and I were seated within 20 minutes. I think we got lucky. The service was very friendly. I am not sure if I like the decor of ceramic and other pig items or not, but I do love how casual and unpretentious The Spotted Pig is. I agree with other yelpers that the tables are packed pretty tight and the low stools do not help out my bad back much. The Spotted Pig Bitter Ale was real ale pulled and served at cellar temperature. The Deviled Eggs had a great taste and texture. The flavors were perfectly balanced in the Seared Squid with Cilantro Butter & Fennel. This is one of the best squid dishes I've had in a while. When asked for a personal recommendation our waitress boasted that the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings was one of the best burgers in The City. The meat in the burger was packed very lightly, which allowed for maximum moisture in it. Tossing the shoestring fries with fresh rosemary put The Spotted Pig's fries on my 'best fries' radar.   I am not sure if the burger is one of the best in the city but it was pretty damn good. Crispy Pork Belly with Bean Purée also came with swiss (maybe rainbow?) chard. The pork belly was perfectly seasoned and I barely needed a knife to cut in it to it. Summer Pudding with Creme Fraiche was the first time I've seen a cold pudding served in the United States and did not disappoint. I think the pudding was even made in a proper pudding basin. I would advise against ordering this dish unless you really love tart summer berries. I enjoyed it very much. Probably the best part of the meal was my coffee that was served in a French press. Like the squid it was one of the best coffees I've had recently. The coffee was on par with European coffee.",1

Deviled Eggs - They look ordinary enough, but after you take your first bite, you can tell they have something a little extra, I'm thinking maybe olive oil? I'm probably totally off LOL Chicken Liver Toast - I could subsist on this alone.  It was so rich and creamy, the toast was toasted to perfection.  This was pure 't enough words in the world to describe it. Crispy Pig's Ear with Lemon, Capers & Trevise - Oh , but I couldn't help myself.  The ears were cooked to perfection.  If not done properly, pig's ears can turn out very tough to eat and not tender at all.  Obviously, they knew what they were doing. Seared Squid with Cilantro Butter & Fennel - What a surprise it was to get a little spicy kick at the end of first bite.  But absolutely a good surprise.  This dish was full of flavor, the squid was 't need ketchup, ranch, 1000 Island, whatever you normally use.

I also had the Deviled Egg, it was very , very salty and covered in olive oil, certainly not a negative but it definitely does nothing to make it more enjoyable. I went back again a few days later to give it another shot, this time for lunch and ordered the exact same thing, it was quite a bit better this time but still the same complaints. Additionally, a friend ordered the burger and asked for a different type of cheese and they said the Chef does not allow substitutions on her ""creations."" Weird. All in all, It is over-salted and overpriced. Definitely an establishment heavily benefiting from the hype surrounding it.

Chef April Bloomfield is a disciple of the Fergus Henderson school of thought regarding cooking.  In other words, waste nothing.  Use the ENTIRE animal.  And she does it well (although not as obviously as Fergus or Ali of the Kebab Cafe in Astoria).  The Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi is a masterpiece, as is the pig's ear (I know, sounds gross but it tastes great).

The seasoning is perfect.  For entree, we ordered the 'cubano' with gruyere, and the chargrilled burger with roquefort. The cubano, although tasty, was not oustanding.

It was still like ground meat straight from the butcher.  Don't people usually order on the rare side b/c they want those juices following between the bun?  Not this, it was just bright pink ground meat with no flavor and not that much juice.  There's a heavy load of roquefort cheese on the thick burger that made it WAY too salty.  The cheese just sort of got in the way.   The fries are the extra skinny kind - like potato match sticks with rosemary and too much salt.  I'm a steak fries - tater tots - curly fries kind of girl so these extra skinny fries didn't interest me much.  You have to stick a whole fistful in your mouth to get any sort of substance.  Not very ladylike.

Potted plants abound outside with benches and a place to relax while waiting. The interior is a take on a country pub style, with plenty of kitsch and old-world charm. The waiters come in sneakers and t-shirts, and a sheet of brown construction paper covers each white table cloth. But the hostess and the waitstaff all know where they work, and treat a customer how you would expect. Not directly rude, but definitely aloof and uninterested. I overheard our waiter making fun of the patron at the next table for thinking a menu item was a sandwich. Speaking of sandwiches, a stop here is supposedly incomplete without a chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese ($17). It comes best medium-rare says the chef, and is served with a heaping mound of shoestring fries. I found the whole experience from start to finish extremely salty. The roquefort was definitely the most memorable part of the meal, the sheep's milk cheese definitely a good companion to a burger. Both the interesting bun and saltiness of everything got me deconstructing the burger to check out the interior. I tasted the meat on its own and it proved to be the source of the salt. The grilled on both sides bun was very well-prepared. I would have thought it were an accident had the shoestring fries and the other dish on the table not been so salty as well. The prosciutto & ricotta tart with marjoram ($18) was the more tasty of the two meals, with its ingredients standing out more from the salt than on the burger. The ricotta was especially delicious, but I feel like marjoram was used instead of oregano only to sound fancier. The tart flaked off well, and was probably the reason we waited about 25 minutes for our food to come in a fairly empty restaurant.",0

They only take one order for the table, so we had to wait for the guy that supposedly was in the bathroom (but he was now lost, unable to find his way back). So after about another 20 minutes of waiting, we finally agreed to order for him (as he cabbed back to our location). The waiter was a bit pushy, and pretty much told us what to order. When we order the burger for our friend that was ""in the bathroom"", he told us that he will put his order for medium instead of medium rare, due to his fake ""illness"". Anyway, after this whole crazy mess, we were finally able to get our hands on the burger. It came w/ a plateful of shoestring fries made w/ rosemary and garlic. But it was the burger that completely knocked it out of the ballpark for me. I only had 1/2 a burger (thinking the whole thing would be too much since I had dinner),  but that 1/2 a burger was insane. The patty was thick, juicy, and tender in every bite. But it was the cheese that makes the burger. The cheese is a roquefort cheese, which is a blue cheese. When its on the burger, it is not very strong. But its the other flavors of the cheese that literally felt like a marching band of various flavors going through my mouth. You don't need anything else to enhance the flavor of this burger. I'm almost 100% sure if you try by adding ketchup or other types of condiments you only ruin the fantastic explosion of taste in your mouth. That being said, the guy that had his burger done to medium complained that the burger tasted ""dry"". Eh, that's what happens when you were ""supposedly"" in the bathroom for 20 minutes. As for the fries, they were good, actually quite addicting, after downing 1/2 a burger and still craving for something more. But I definitely felt a blister on my tongue after going through a good chunk of the fries. Stick w/ the burger (and whatever else that they have that's ""not on the menu""), and don't let the waiter convince you out of it. I won't elaborate more than that, but we're still regretting about that part.",1
62588,1814,4.0,1,2009-05-23,"let me just , funky dining experiences i've had in NY. the minute my sister and i saw the pig-sculpture poking out of the restaurant and walked into the place, i felt like i was teleported into a harry potter-esque, Platform 13 1/2 nestled somewhere between 2 centuries. we got there early so luckily were seated quickly in a tiny corner. the bar area was crowded w/ a bunch of guys - one dude had the loudest voice on earth and the sad thing is, he didnt' even realize it. aside from the noise, the rest of the dining experience was amazing. the menu was so unique and everything explained to us so meticulously by the waitress. here's what we ordered: - Chicken Liver Toast appetizer: liver pate over thick slices of crunchy bread. the first bite left us speechless. actually, so did every other bite. but by the end we felt it was so rich and the pate to toast ratio was too high. - Sheep Ricotta Gnudi: so so so so so so good. almost orgasmic. so many flavors hit you - soft ricotta, brown-butter sauce, sage, pasta, parmesan. you have to love cheese to enjoy this dish. but it comes with about 6 pieces which you must share because it is so rich. i could feel my arteries clogging, but was willing to compromise one cigarette for 3 gnudies. soooo good and perfect texture - Asparagus + Crab Sald: this was a seasonal special. The crab was not too salty (unlike a similar dish at Nougatine!!!), and the lemon hollandaise sauce was perfection. i love asparagus but always try to eat it in moderation (you know, because it makes your pee smell) - and & Asparagus: this was an overwhelming dish - my sister and i could barely finish because it was just tooo much meat. if you haven't had heart, be prepared for a sort of slippery texture. the meat is smooth and red (no fat or marble texture). we agreed it did not come with enough greens or carbs, so the variety was unbalanced. all in all, this whole meal was simply amazing and so different from what i've tried and other overpriced restaurants. the tab came out to about $80 for 2 (no drinks) which was not bad considering how much we ate. next time my sis and i are going to try the burger. seriously, every other order that came out of the kitchen was a burger. must be something good about ",1

Get ready to wait for a table, but trust me, it's worth it.  The bar gets pretty crowded later in the night, so consider staying for some drinks and meet some locals for an exchange of witty drunken banter. :)",1

We ordered some appetizers. The gnudi, phenomenal! (but i suspect anything drowned in butter will taste great)... the other appetizer, some sort of non-chicken fried egg on a bed of greens, also quite delightful. The next wave was the real disappointment. All 3 of us at the table got the famous burgers there. (i was going for the halibut but they were out - wtf?). I got mine medium-rare, the meat was OK... but the blue cheese they put on the top completely masked the meat , nice and thin and crispy with probably a touch of thyme (was it?)... but I felt like they had dragged my fries into the dead sea before putting them on my plate (ie: they were overly salty) ? Maybe for the 's. Updated 11/22/2010: I went back here again this past week and re-confirmed my aversion to the ""blasts of salt"" (…) they use in the cuisine. I think Mayor Bloomberg needs to pay a visit ...  To their credit though - the drinks are good - but thats not too hard to achieve in NYC.",0

Some people who come here can be rude, this woman kept putting her drink on our table while she posed for pictures, we recommended that she stop the waiter backed us up. Our waiter was amazing, some time around 2:00 am their computers crashed and all orders entered that night were lost so all the wait staff scrambled to add up the tabs which required them to go to several patrons and ask what they had for dinner. It was crazy but they handled it with finesse, well our waiter did at least. We offered up our cell phones so he could calculate the tab. In any event is a chill place to get some late night grub and peep an occasional celeb.

27574,1814,4.0,1,2009-05-06,"My cousin visited for a weekend, so I committed myself to giving her a varied and delicious food experience. Decently priced and delicious food at a hip location with great atmosphere? Yeah, I totally get the award for best host. She had the burger and I had the gnudi. The gnudi is magically delicious and salty. They're basically ricotta surrounded by dough with a brown butter sauce and fried bay leaves. The first bite was an orgasm in my mouth. Maybe a little too intense, because after the third one, the saltiness was overpowering. To extend my analogy, it's like getting stretched every which way with satisfying results, but after a while, you just need a break. The burger was a homer, as always. Juicy and flavorful. The roquefort cheese adds a nice zing, though I have a love/hate relationship with blue cheese on my burgers. Nice, yes, but sometimes, all you can taste is the blue cheese. I love the fries here, which are skinny. I grab a big clump, making sure to get some of the fried rosemary and garlic slices, and stuff 'em in my mouth. The first time I came here, I came alone. The gentleman next to me ordered a burger, which was what I planned on getting. I ordered it, and made a vow to eat slightly less than he did. I did. I finished my burger, and only ate half my fries (he ate three quarters of them), but man, was it tough. The cubano here is also excellent. I hate crowds, and they have a late lunch menu. A lot of things aren't on there, but the burger makes an appearance. When I came with my cousin for Friday lunch, we waited thirty minutes (the hostess called us--we wandered around the area). The pig up front is too cute, and I love the flowers that abound outside.",1

We met an older English couple at the bar and they said it's their favorite pub in NYC and perhaps in the entire world! My friend and I sat at the window perch for dinner. I had the veggie platter which was the most unique preparation of veggies I've ever had. They were lightly fried (with no breading) and still retained the veggie consistency so that I could tell what each vegetable was. Included Minty Potatoes, Roasted Beets & Greens, Braised Peas & Escarole, Flowering Rabe with Crispy Shallots. My friend had the famous burger and shoestring fries. Yes, the burger is good, the ""gamey"" flavor that one yelper mentioned must have been the blue cheese (the meat is not lamb). The shoestring fries are prepared very similar to the veggies in my platter (crispy since they were so thin, yet you could still taste the potato on the inside). Will definitely be coming here again.",1

I needed to eat. It truly was another 30 minutes to wait for a table!! We left to be smart for the lack of grub in who knows how many hours but I knew I'd be back. I guess a week later I headed over to a friends new duplex just a hop skip and jump away from the PIG. Sat night around 7, we drop out name into the book, just finished ordering drinks when they were ready to sit us??!! Yes, I know I'm no fun because I don't eat pork but I did find food to eat.

The service was a bit spotty, but I'm willing to overlook that because of the fantastic dinner I experienced. I got the Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings and it was great! The shoestring fries were incredible and I honestly could've eaten them for months. The desert was also fantastic. Flourless Chocolate Cake was great.",1

19065,1814,4.0,1,2009-04-30,"I live a life of gluttony.  The Spotted Pig fits perfectly into that lifestyle. All the dishes we tried screamed RICH.  Every bite was jam-packed with flavor and even though the portions aren't huge, my date and I were both completely stuffed after our dinner. We came on a Wednesday night around 8 PM and there was an hour wait.  We killed time at a neighboring bar until the hostess called and let us know our table was ready.  After reading all the yelp reviews, we ordered the ricotta gnudi and were not disappointed.  Soft pillowy blobs of ricotta, bathed in brown butter and sage leaves-- how could you go wrong?  I won't say they're life-changing, but definitely worth ordering. After ordering the wild striped bass and braised rabbit (no, we did NOT order the burger) our waiter helped pick out an excellent bottle of wine that would fit both of our entrees.  The striped bass came out flaky and perfectly cooked.  The small portion of mashed potatoes were forgettable but the fish more than made up for it.  The braised rabbit was so decadent, I had to know what they did to that poor bunny to make him so tasty.  The rabbit was atop the most rich broth I had tasted-- you could really tell the amount of time and skill it took to concoct it. I loved the casual environment of the venue and thought the service was impeccable.  Our waiter went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and even helped us make after-dinner plans since we weren't familiar with the neighborhood.   If your arteries are up for the challenge, Spotted Pig is worth checking out!",1

I also tried the Ricotta Gnudi, which tasted like a stuffed gnocchi. It was tasty and flavorful, but nothing I'd ever crave. The fries were heaped on the burger and they were okay, but nothing spectacular. Service was spotty and I had to stand up to find my own ketchup. I don't like sitting on stools without backs.

I do not recommend this restaurant for children or for veggietarians.  The Spotted Pig does not accept reservations or delivery or take-out.  The name of this restaurant/bar saids it all:  Spotted Pig which implies meat.

47022,1814,4.0,1,2009-04-17,"The GF and I finally decided to check out this most ballyhooed of gastropubs on a random Sunday.  We predicted a lengthy wait, but when the gentleman at the door told us it would be an hour and change for a table, I unsuccessfully tried to audible to Fatty Crab down the street.  I lost. We entered the bar area, where I was emasculated each time I tried to get the bartender's attention or body checked by other patrons.  The ladyfriend didn't seem to mind, but that's probably because she's gotten used to my bar anxiety, mostly the result of my persistent inability to find a place to stand that is not blocking foot traffic.  Once the bartender was done playing hard to get, I ordered the cask drawn Otis Stout from the bar, which was lovely and maybe even worth the nine dollars it cost.  Halfway through the drink, however, and after waiting for only twenty or so minutes, we were informed that our table was ready.  O RLY?  A pleasant surprise, but why was our wait time so over quoted? We waffled over a couple items on the menu, but ultimately settled for the house classics. We shared the brown-butter-and-sage-bathed ricotta gnudi, which I believe our waitperson informed us to be a flourless dumpling.  Essentially they're tasty little cheese and butter explosions in your mouth, and every bit the sexual experience the description suggests.   Unlike several others below, I really enjoyed my roqeufort burger -- surprising since I have avoided the blue cheese and beef combination for many years.  I agree that the cheese stands out but, given that the burger consists of only three parts (beef, cheese, bun), it can't really be said to overpower as much as share equal time with the other ingredients.   The little shoestring fries were also delicious, but completely dependent on the bits of fried garlic and rosemary accompanying them.  GF went for the braised rabbit that she seemed to enjoy.  I tasted it at some point, but was too distracted by my dish to appreciate it.  I think she was jealous of my fries. All in all, it was what I expected -- a packed, overpriced, but ultimately quality restaurant.  I would give three and a half stars, and would maybe go back with someone from out of town.",1

I had the burger and my friend had the cubano.  The first hint that it wouldn't be great was when I asked for some mayo for my burger.  The waitress told me sorry they can't give me any mayo because they don't want to serve jarred mayo and it's too much trouble to give people the home made stuff.  It wasn't that they didn't HAVE mayo, it just wasn't included in my *$17* burger.  Not even a dollop.  Well, it did come with one of our apps so I ended up having to save it on the dirty dish, guarding it till I got my entree. This could have been forgiven if the burger was TDF but sadly no.  It came with a scoop of blue cheese on top and that really pushed the salt limit over the top, even after I removed some of it.  The shoestring fries didn't add anything. A lot of texture but not much flavor unless you count the rosemary they toss in with the fries.  Oh but they did serve STORE BOUGHT ketchup with the fries (and not even Hunt's--it was Heinz) I honestly think the shakeshack burgers are better and even their frozen fries are more satisfying.  The cubano was very very good.  Dessert was not memorable.  I may come back and try some dinner to see what the fuss is about.  The total bill for the lunch came to  about $90 incl tip no alcohol.

Here was my lunchtime order: 1 seafood chowder = $15 1 Burger = $17 1 Old Speckled Hen = $8 Now, the median price for an Old Speckled Hen at NYC bars is $6.75, according to BeerM(an amazing resource). Of course, they've got the Pig's draft OSH incorrectly listed as $7. But that it were so! No, your draft beer here is $8, which is the price of a full lunch special at many other places in the city. Beer is a commodity, so pricing it very high pisses me off. Now to the food. They can charge $15 for their chowder I guess. I paid that, after all, but it's still an absurd price for a soup.

It is an extremely high quality restaurant, with a carefully and very well done casual atmosphere that resembles a crowded and homey pub. That doesn't mean you won't wait forty minutes to get a table. That doesn't mean you won't be spending 8 dollars on draft beer. And that certainly doesn't mean that you'll be getting your typical cheeseburger. This isn't classic pub food. Its a modern, expensive, and a little 't be surprised when you get blue cheese on your burger, try to have an open mind towards some well-done experimentation. The fritters were perfection. The oysters were fresh, cold, and came with a great tangy dip sauce. The artichoke salad was light with an incredibly flavorful dressing.

I asked for a side of tomato and lettuce and was told they couldn't do that.  Seriously???  Am I expecting too much to want a slice of tomato??  And the  They were disgusting.  I ate about half of them because I was hungry, but was annoyed with each bite.  They really need new fries.  Or at least give us a choice: would you like normal french fries, or nasty shoe string fries that are so thin that you can see through them? Overall, I'm glad I tried this place.  I wish it lived up to the high expectations that I had set for it.",0

The staff was really nice.  No rush to get you out, which is probably partly to blame for the wait, but once you are in it's nice to not have them trying to get you out.  All in all in it made for a nice  evening with the girlfriend and I would go back because of that.",0

The food was superb - the Gnocchi made me religious - and the wine list had some interesting things on it. Price-wise, it was a little less than I expected for the quality. Everything about the food was absolutely phenomenal, and I can't wait to go back. The problem is their no-reservation policy and weirdly-placed location - there's no nearby subway, so you're going to be walking over no matter what you do, and you'll probably find a miserable and hungry-looking crowd sitting outside.

52241,1814,5.0,1,2009-03-20,"I finally made it over to check out the highly hyped Spotted Pig and to be honest, I've held out for so long because I really didn't expect it to live up to expectations. This is a place that I was told about from Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix) back in July of last year before I moved to NYC - I wish I would have taken his word for it and come here much sooner. I fully expected to wait, and we did for about an hour. No big deal - we headed up stairs and had a couple of pints to pass the time. The atmosphere was great. So original and the smell, well, from the moment I walked in I knew that I'd be willing to wait all night for the table because of the aroma. The appetizers that some groups around us had looked great but we opted out that night.. I had one thing on my mind, a burger. We finally sat down and I knew exactly what I wanted, a beer and a burger and we didn't have to wait too long for it to come out. This burger is awesome. Yes, it is something like $17 for the fries and all but let me tell you, I never felt guilty about it. So juicy and full of flavor - Very, very good. The fries were awesome as well, although, they are so small that they are kind of hard to eat, but whatever. These aren't McDonalds fries so don't expect that. All in all, both of us agreed that this place was totally worth the wait and price - and a place that I can easily picture myself going to anytime that I am in the mood for a burger, even if I'm alone.",1
5619,1814,3.0,1,2009-03-18,"Ok the picture of the fried cheese balls with the herbs on top - that thing is genius. I had those with the old speckled hen ale and it was a perfect combo. I have no idea how many calories are in them (guessing close to a million) but you've probably left those kinds of concerns at the door when you go to the Spotted Pig. I agree with what everyone is saying about the wait ! I'm not surprised at all with the wait. More important to me is that they actually tell you what the time is going to be and they seem to be pretty accurate. On top of that, they could be nose-in-the-air snobs and get away with it but they don't! Really impressed with that. So why am I stripping them of two stars? Their famous burger is, quite frankly, crap. The meat was beautiful but they loaded it up with blue cheese until you could barely taste it. Having blue cheese on a burger is great but its like saying having sugar in your coffee is great - it doesn't mean you want 10 cubes. The second star - can we just distribute note pads to the city's wait staff? Our waitress was really cool but she didn't write anything down and if you can memorize 3 dishes, I really don't care. Right? I mean we're not talking rain man here - we're talking 3 dishes but if you write them down, I'm not annoyed either. Great, making good use of pen and 'ed but we had long finished our mains and were waiting and :15 on a Tuesday night, after 5 drinks, I'm thinking more about my bed and less about beets and greens. Sorry, 2nd 't blow me away enough and the prices seem a bit high for what they're offering. Probably worth a visit but if I were in the neighborhood and wanted a good burger, I'd probably head to corner bistro, not get blown away by blue cheese and pay $11 less.",0
7582,1814,2.0,1,2009-03-16,"Maybe I'm crazy, maybe my taste buds are out whack, maybe the restaurant was having an off tonight, or maybe my expectations were just too high. But after hearing rave after rave about the burger from Spotted Pig, and after eating many a burger in New York, I have to say I was very disappointed in the whole dish. We started off with the chicken liver toasts which was pretty tasty but very rich. Although they're not the biggest slices triangles of toast because it's so rich you could probably share among 4 people who just wanted to get a good taste of it. We then ordered our burgers. Granted I am not the biggest fan of blue cheese, but the cheese made the burger incredibly salty. Usually there is some sort of balance with the saltiness of the cheese, some sort of crisp component -- something to take the edge off the saltiness and enhance the flavor. But this time it fell flat. All I could taste was the cheese and the beef, though cooked perfectly was tender and juicy, but because of the cheese the entire burger was too salty. Unfortunately the side that came with it, the rosemary shoestring fries, were way, way too salty. I love the idea of fried garlic chips and fried rosemary leaves along with the shoestring fries, and I love skinny, crispy fries, but these were too liberally seasoned with salt. Together, the burger and the fries made for 4 glasses of water and still left me longing for more liquids. It is, admittedly, huge portions (at least the burger and fries were). But considering the flavor, the saltiness, the big disappointment $17 was too much to pay for this experience. The service was good here though -- water was always refilled, our bottle was refilled and returned to our table, the waitress was very friendly and always served with a smile and a chipper attitude. Never gave us a condescending or angry sneer when we didn't order any drinks besides water, or didn't order dessert. No rushing whether or not there was a line waiting for tables. All in ",0

I wasn't sure what to expect, although it was recommended to me by the manager of my favorite restaurant (one of the top 10 in the US). The atmosphere was amazing, it just has a great feeling to it. I got a Spotted Pig Bitter to start, and we had the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage, and we each had a Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings.. It was like levitation. I returned for lunch on a holiday weekend, and the wait was only 30 minutes (which is highly unusual during their 7-10 rush, which could take , so worth it).

Now I came here very hungover so all I cared about initially was water. I pounded the first bottle that came to our table. I was very lucky to be joined by two fellow foodies, so we decided to split the beef hash, french toast and the burger. Each had a very different flavor and they actually complemented each other well! The beef hash is a variation on the commoner's corned beef hash. It was served with poached eggs which were light and fluffy although the dish was a tad spicy for all of our palates. The french toast was the ""GOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAL"" moment. Thick bread toasted just enough to make the outside crispy but still soft in the middle, it has a syrup that is to die for! The burger was served with a very powerful roquefort blue cheese, which unfortunately overpowered the melt-in-your-mouth beef and the grilled bun. A little less cheese would have made it swell. The skinny fries with rosemary were spot on though. My two companions had mimosas but with a lingering hangover, I opted for the coffee. And let me tell you - it was AMAZING coffee.

Brunch this weekend, however, was all around top notch.  We got there early (12:30ish) so the wait wasn't too long.  The service was fantastic (and I don't say that lightly - I was a server for years and have high standards).  I had the burger, which totally deserves its reputation, along with a mountain delicious rosemary fries. My friends had the french toast (which I didn't try) and the Cuban sandwich (which I did - awesome). I managed to also knock back a couple of their bloody marys, which were a perfect accompaniment to the burger. The decor here is great, and makes for a warm and cozy environment.  The only drawback is how cramped it can get, especially when crowded, but after living in the East Village for four years, if there is one thing I am used to - it's small, crowded bars/restaurants.

This is a loud, brash, riotous fantasy island for the lover of all things meaty and true. Just penning this review is calling up memories of rich, fatty, raw goodness. Excuse me, I need a moment. , they have a fish dish on the menu, but the only true vegetable dishes are the sides, which are mostly potatoes (you can order a ""meal"" of 4 side dishes). I'm sorry for people to feel left out, but such is life. This is a meaty place. Embrace it. We started out with the pork rillettes. They were served cold with a glistening layer of fat on top and they came with hefty slabs of grilled bread, cornichons, and mustard. They were so fabulously good - the fat alone was good enough to eat by itself. The mustard cut the richness perfectly. For our entrees we had the skirt steak and the hamburger. The steak is only served medium rare. It glistens and is so flavorful that you want to get up out of your chair (I'm sorry, rickety little stool) and do a happy dance.I have no recollection whatsoever as to of what the skirt steak was served with because it was totally, utterly irrelevant. The hamburger was brought out on a plate heaped 100 miles high with shoestring fries (see photo above). They were really salty (in a good way) and had been tossed with crispy rosemary leaves, an ideal companion for the salt. It was perfectly pink from top to bottom and so tender and warm that it felt a little (indecently) like eating a live animal might. The flavor was a mild, addictive, almost olive-oily beef taste. No pushy seasonings, just the highest quality, perfectly cooked ground beef. The blue cheese was all the adornment needed. Now high on protein, we were somehow persuaded by our server to try a dessert called the ""Banoffe"" - a sort of layered puff pastry dish with sliced bananas, Dulce de Leche, and cream. Weird but good.",1

I wanted to split the burger and the cubano with a buddy, so we asked if the chef could cut the burger in half and HE REFUSED - what a douche!   Also the cubano completely sucked ass.  I didn't think you could screw up a cubano so bad.  It was over seasoned and there were NO PICKLES on it - instead they used some bland chopped green pepper.  The cheese was greasy, tasteless, and abundant.  Plus I'm not sure if they put the sandwich in a press - seemed like it was finished in an oven.  Either way, it was left in there way too long as the bread was hard and burnt.

They started seating around 5:30 and my group of three had a table by 5:45, leaving enough time to enjoy a Spotted Pig bitter on cask at the bar. Food and service were good, but I think 3 stars is the right rating here since I'm not convinced the food should command such high prices. The caesar salad was quite good, and made correctly with thick eggy dressing and anchovies throughout - not remotely a healthy ordering option, but tasty. Prosciutto fritters, the appetizer special for the day, were tasty also - then again, it is hard to go wrong with deep fried balls of spinach, prosciutto, and cheese. But on to our primary objective. The burger was well-sized and the meat was quite good - I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked as such. It wasn't outstanding meat, though, just a very competently executed burger. Roquefort cheese on top adds a somewhat unique quality to it, but I've had blue cheese burgers elsewhere for half the price that I enjoyed just as much. Bummer! The search for the best burger continues. As other reviewers say, though, the place has a novel atmosphere and the fries were good, so I wasn't terribly disappointed with it, I'd go back but I'd take a Corner Bistro burger (or a Mr. Bartley's burger back in Boston!) over another SP burger if I'm looking to maximize my intake of beefy goodness.",0

14321,1814,4.0,1,2009-02-01,"The Spotted Pig definitely has hidden cameras hooked up to their host stand, or the host himself most certainly has some sort of camera embedded into his pupils. The fact that my friend and I were able to put our names down, go upstairs for forty-five minutes, and be approached by a server with menus who never saw us before but knew the name, was remarkable. A point to note: I have never been to the Spotted Pig but I was absolutely taken in by all of the pig decor and the lively feel of the bar area. Definitely like a classy British pub. My friend and I were seated downstairs and were left to mull over what the hell to get. I'm usually the one who takes charge, commanding that my friends order this this and this, but with no prior knowledge I let my friend decide with everything. Here's what we ordered: 1) Devils on Horseback - a first for me. I can't think of a better combination than sticky sweet prunes and smoky bacon. Orgasm in bite size form. 2)  Rollmops - I was always curious about this Dutch delicacy, so I jumped at the opportunity to have some. Delicious, but probably more so if you like fish. 3) Chicken Liver on Toast - At first I was skeptical, not being a huge fan of liver, but I have to say this spreadable organ, combined with the excellent bread, was like having a crush on the kid who previously pulled my hair throughout kindergarten. 4) Smoked haddock chowder - the complete antithesis of the goop fit for invalids from my youth. This chowder seemed to have a mirepoix of potatoes and fish, to use the term loosely, but I was enamored by the precise cubes that dominated the flavorful soup. The homemade crackers were like crunchy little pillows for Thumbalina(Thumbelina?): fabulous. 5) Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi - I felt it was necessary to get the Pig's most well known dish, just to see what all of the fuss was about. It's the classic unfinishable dish - it's extremely rich and very heavy, but three little balls won't set you back too much. 6) Crispy Pig's Ear Salad - another first for me, but a tasty one. I always assumed pigs' ears would be chewy  and more likely to be gnawed on, but this was extremely creamy, with the outward appearance of a giant dorito turned inside of itself. So creamy and fatty in fact, that I had to use the toothpicks from the devil's on horseback to unstick it from my teeth. Anyway, what made the dish a winner was its pairing with plenty of lettuces and a super acidic vinaigrette. An unusual dish worthy of trying out. To end the night, we had tea because we couldn't possibly tackle dessert. While everything was delicious and the atmosphere convivial and exciting, I was put off by how incredibly fast everything came out.  We weren't even finished with appetizers before the soup we shared came out, and we weren't even finished with that before the entrees were plopped down on the tiny table.

16036,1814,3.0,1,2009-01-24,"I am going to deviate a bit from the populist view of SP and give it an average rating. For anyone who doesn't like crowded noisy places, this place is not for you. For those who think you can grab a quick bite because you're  pressed for time, forget about this place completely and go somewhere else. The average wait for a table for 4 is 2 hours. Yes, 2 hours. The only way around this is to arrive before 5:30 and then put your name on the list at precisely 5:30 and then get seated shortly thereafter. Any other time, you'll have to wait and wait and wait. If you're with good friends and have lots to catch up on, not a problem. The catch though, is that they have a bar where you can get liquored up for those two hours and therefore blow a bunch on alcohol before you even order. And then by the time you order, you're drunk and so you're more apt to exercise less restraint and order expensive items. Brilliant! The owners deliberately lower your expectations of food as it's billed as British pub fare (ie: fish 'n chips, shepard's pie), but when you charge pretty much full-restaurant prices, I expect full-restaurant service and quality. Once seated, the service was quite good, though being seated right near the entrance, sitting on a stool and getting purses, jackets and elbows in my back all evening wasn't pleasant. I guess this is all part of the charm. Foodwise, everything was pretty tasty. We shared a few appy's, including the sweetbreads (be brave, they're good!), the gnudi (ricotta filled dumplings) and the prosciutto tart. We're off to a good start. Two of us had the burger w/blue cheese - an interesting combo - one had the striped bass and I tried the quail. I would say they were all fairly tasty but quite salty. I wouldn't normally put that much salt on my food, but I suppose it's their way to get you to order more drinks. I'd say there is a strong novelty factor at this place so it's worth a visit. But then again, there are other places that don't make you wait 2 hours to eat a $17 burger after you've spent $30 on drinks at the bar.",0

As we were led to our table, I looked around at the decor.  I loved the random hodge podge of ceramic plates, paintings, and old school posters but at the same time it added to the claustraphobic feeling inside the restaurant. We ate on the second floor, which was just as crammed as the first. Too many people milling around the bar area and the tables are situated crushed along the walls. I't really been in such a setting before (for a pricey restaurant). The tables are small and you have to sit on a , the decor was not to my liking but these reviews are more about the food. Finally food time! For starters, we selected the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart with Marjoram and the Crispy Pig's Ear. I was intrigued by the latter and both were simply delicious. Piglet's ear was like crunch salty bacon. Yum! Oh yet another reason why I can never truly become a vegetarian. For our main courses we had the venison (a special that day) and the Sautéed Quail with Roasted Treviso & Parmesan.  The venison was a little too rare for my liking but paired with the sauce and my wine, it all went down well. The quail was also a little heavy on the sauce. It was however cooked very well and the meat was juicy.  And because I am a french fry-a-holic, I had to have the shoe string fries. Bingo! Grease + salt + rosemary = a winner. For dessert we split a slice of ginger cake which was a my bf predicted, more like a gingerbread cookie. It was super moist and delicious so I had no complaints. Overall we thought the starters (called 'plates' on the menu) were the clear winners. The portions were generous (compared to the entrees) and we probably should have just ordered 4 plates instead.  The atmosphere was nice but too noisy. We agreed that we've had better food for the price but it's definitely worth trying at least once. Expect to spend between $100-200 for two. Perhaps after I visit another gastropub I can revise my feelings about the atmosphere. But for now, I'll let the food own this rating :)",1

Being holiday weekend and all, the place was packed, and since the play was starting at 8, we couldn't stick around for a table. the staff pointed us to the bar upstairs and we grabbed a couple of seats without having to wait more than a couple of minutes (great timing). We started with a serving of 6 oysters with a nice horseradish accompaniment. I then spied a couple eating some marinated olives, and I ordered us some. Yummy. For dinner, we shared a perfectly cooked medium rare burger with blue cheese and very thin and crispy shoe string fries. Everyone around us was eating the same thing. The fries were okay, but the burger was delicious, melt in your mouth delicious. The hubby ordered a prosciutto and goat cheese tart with some mixed greens on top (a starter acting as entree).

Having southern roots you'd think I would have had pig's ears, but I hadn't. I was apprehensive, but willing to try the many items on the menu that sounded impressive. I asked our waitress what were her 4 favorite things on the menu, and thankfully she named delights we were eying: Pig's Ears Salad, Ricotta Gnudi Balls, Calf's Liver and Beef Tongue. Unbelievable. The gnudi balls and pig's ears arrived first. The salty, crispy ear strips tasted finer than bacon over arugula and field greens with a punchy vinaigrette dressing. The surprising balls were a delicate and savory experience with the right balance of salt and cheese. Now I'm not normally drawn to menu items that include such words as ""liver"" or ""tongue,"" but my apprehension vanished with my first bites. The tongue had a delightfully light steak flavor with the tenderness of the best rib eye. An absolute delight. The calf's liver was also tasty and tender, although it didn't pack the ambrosial flavor punch of the other items we selected. I would definitely return, and perhaps soon.

We had heard horror stories about how busy it can be at night, and so we opted to preempt the long wait by lunching there instead. (A tactic we employ quite often for the better restaurants -- lunch is always easier, and somehow, more decadent too). And so lunch it was. We walked into a half empty restaurant, and were seated right away upstairs. The waitstaff was pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive. Even with our high hopes, we were most pleasantly surprised. Much like its London brethren St. John's restaurant, the Spotted Pig revels in the extraordinary. A sensational menu, packed with many traditional items, most of which you will never find in a restaurant these days. Definitely worth all the hoopla. I had the chicken liver on toast to start, and then for the main course, faggots. Yep, faggots. A traditional sausage-like dish from the Midlands (in England). I remember having them a few times as a kid when we lived near Worcester (again, England), but the faggots at the Spotted Pig were better than anything I remember. Aside from their unusual name (particularly to American ears), this is one of best dishes you can choose, when prepared well. Mine were superb. Essentially a home-made sausage of pig cheeks and pig liver, wrapped in some sort of natural sausage casing, seared, and served in a shallow bed of au jus and topped with mustard and crispy pig ears. I know, I know -- perhaps not your normal run-of-the-mill item, but let me tell you, the dish was fantastic. My fellow eaters had equally excellent meals for their lunch, but I cannot honestly remember what they were except A) pig-based, and B) scrumptious. All of this topped with some hearty British ales, and we were as happy as three pigs in a blanket. I can't wait to go there again, to try out the rest of the menu.

They sat us upstairs in the corner room on this awkward tiny table since the olympics were playing (some stupid random event) and they figured we wanted to watch it. After sitting there for 15 mins (after the appetizers came but before the meal) we moved to the corner chairs/table because we couldn't handle the strange seating. We both ordered the burger with the shoe string fries. Let me tell you, that burgers/fries combo was so good I am still thinking about it months later. Yummmmmmmm That's all I'm going to say.

In order to best avoid the dinner rush, my friends and I arrived at The Spotted Pig around 5:30 'd heard, I was pleasantly surprised when our table was ready for us by 6:15 , tree-lined West Village street, The Spotted Pig is adorned with unfinished hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, an old-fashioned mahogany bar, menu specials written on a large brasserie mirror and decor consisting of shabby chotchkies and mismatched plants. To start, I ordered the deviled eggs followed by the infamous Spotted Pig burger (that I'd read so many raves about). The ""eggs"" (note the pluralization) were just one whole egg sliced in half. The cooked yolks were mixed with a zesty mustard blend, crunchy green chives and sprinkled with sea salt. Though I've had better versions, these devils were tasty and just ""enough"" substance to whet my appetite. The moment of truth came as my medium-cooked burger arrived. Enveloped between a grilled brioche bun was a generous portion of beef topped with an ample lathering of pungent and salty Roquefort cheese. Accompanying the sandwich was a mound of homemade shoestring fries, lightly dusted with sea salt and rosemary. Was the burger all it was cracked up to be? Indeed, it was. Though I felt that the amount of Roquefort used was slightly overpowering, the beef patty itself consisted of the highest quality ground meat, producing a juicy, velvety, melt-in-your-mouth masterpiece. My experience at The Spotted Pig was virtually liberated of anything negative that I'd heard. I found the service to be excellent and our wait-time minimal. The food was pretty impressive and I will absolutely return.",0

At this first trip I noticed the curiously pleasing menu item- fried pig ears with sage, lemon and capers. Sounded delish. So we made it a point to stop by another night for dinner to try this fun little dish. Wasn't on the menu. So, be ware, it switches up frequently even though the same items sort of rotate. Instead I had the beef tongue which was so tender and juicy and tasty! Next NY trip, I'll probably poke my head in for a bite or drink again. Oh, and they have awesome tshirts.",1

Even the creamed spinach was far better than I'd ever had -- creamy, but not so much so that it was soggy or mushy, and containing a hint of some spice (cinnamon? nutmeg?)

It was okay but the bacon was WAY salty and the dish didn't come with toast or anything. We also had a french press of coffee (for 3 people) and it was $15! I think that's pretty ridiculous.

Went there on a Friday afternoon for the late lunch menu.  After mourning the fact that we couldn't get the Gnudi, my friend and I recovered, then ordered the chicken liver toast and the roll mops (pickled herring) to start. They were just too sweet!  I've had the liver before, and though this particular incarnation was just as addictive, it had that confusing: Am I a sweet or a savory? Something you don't EVER want to think with liver.  As for the roll mops, we had to smother them in the creme fraiche as the sweetness was cloying. Then the burger came, my second favorite only to the Gnudi.  All I can say is blech. The beef was dry, grainy, gray and tasteless-- I pinched out a piece and ate it all by it's cardboardy self.  The roquefort was overwhelming.  The shoestring fries, I am pleased to report, are just as good as ever with their crispy rosemary and garlic goodness scattered hither and yon. Mmmm. Thank god for them and for the Smoked Haddock Chowder (which I actually had not had before).   This potage had so many levels of bright, alive flavor it practically shone in comparison to the burger.  I could have used more broth in it..I know a chowder is supposed to be thick, but that broth was mmmm delish, I would have loved to slurp away.   Now here is what confuses me: why has The Pig, restaurant of my gastronomic dreams, failed to live up to all my previous visits (last of which, I'll admit, was about 6 months ago)?  I am now afraid to return for fear of being disappointed by what I remember as heavenly Gnudi.  What's worse is that Chef Bloomfield walked through the dining room: I know she was there and I know that THAT food came out of HER kitchen.

For an animal that serves no other practical purpose other than to feed us, this appetizer was sublime. Crispy with a thin layer of chewy cartilage in between was salty, crunchy, and fantastic foil to the endive and watercress salad upon which it rested. You really *can* make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. My entree? I got the burger with the Roquefort on the side. It was ... a burger. The shoestring fries were good, although I've had them in other restaurants back in SF. I probably would have ordered something else, or just kept it to the chicken liver toast and the crispy pig's ear we had ordered for appetizers. My dining companion got the house-made faggot and a side of snap peas with mint, both of which were fantastic. The faggots were pretty rich and super flavorful. They serve you three on a plate, which is more than enough. I will forgive some minor miscalculations in service for plates of deliciousness.

We only had to wait about 15-20 minutes or so, just to give the kitchen time to switch over from the bar menu to the dinner menu. But if you are more planful than I, make reservations.

Well yes, it is hyped and we all know that hype is very hard to live up to. So just ignore the hype. Two reasons you should go: BEER - come-on gastro-beer in Manhattan is not the easiest to get. Spotted Pig has a great variety of imported beers, but you are CRAZY if you pass by the weekly specials and cask beers. Nothing better with a ""pint"" of semi-warmed beer in hand. Sweet. FOOD - two words ""Pig's Ear"". Pass on all the tasty, fragrant morsels that pass by, the wonderful devils on horse back or the blue cheese anything, instead move to the whole reason you suffer through a dry Sunday roast of pork with Granny - because of the crackling! It's a perfectly formed pig's ear of pure crackling - delicious to the last lip smacking bite (sorry to my vegetarian friend next to me - ooops), complete with a caper berry salad to cut the sense of fat. I think I died and went to heaven. LOL who cares about the ""scene"".

I can't say enough good things about the burger. If you don't like blue cheese, it might not be a highlight, but I love it, so I am addicted! The shoestring fries that come with it are also to die for! There are tiny bits of fried garlic and rosemary mixed into the fries. My other experiences have included the raw oysters - good; deviled eggs - don't go here without ordering them; devils on horseback - tasty, but sweet. This time around we tried the lemon-lime tart for dessert, so refreshing and yummy. I really can't think of a negative, yet. I'm trying very hard (that's what she said).

My friend M and I heard 3 different languages as we sat to order from the late lunch menu. M ordered the infamous burger and I ordered the smoked haddock chowder, and we ended up sharing. We had to get their on tap Speckled Hen - went great with both the burger and chowder. The burger was soooo good. Very simple. Just meat + cheese + bun. We even asked the waitress if there were any add-on options to the burger but she politely suggested that once we tried the burger, we wouldn't want to add anything to it. She was right! The quality of these 3 ingredients (I wish I knew what bread they used, the cheese was Roquefort) made one savory, tasty burger. The burger came with a  heaping side of shoestring fries. I liked how they added little pieces of fried garlic and rosemary. Yum! I wish I could say my haddock chowder was just as good, but it was alright.

I went here on Friday night to meet up with an old high school friend.  Since I've been wanting to come here for a while, I thought this was a good opportunity. First of all, walking to this part of the city, far enough away from the subway stop, in the midst of tree-lined West Village blocks, feels fairy-tale-esque.  As my friend said, ""It's amazing what a walk in West Village can do.""   Anyway, on the corner of the seemingly elusive West 11th Street (if you're not from the area, it's difficult to find.  It's like the disappearing Harry Potter staircases in Hogwarts), you'll see a little black and white spotted pig hanging over the door.  This is it.  I walked in and sort of felt like I was in a hobbit's house - which is a good thing in my book.  Everyone was eating, drinking and merry-making like it was Bilbo's last night in the Shire.  Though the hostess said there was a 45 minute wait, I wasn't too upset about it because of the festive atmosphere, the beautiful weather, the bench outside and the potential to explore the neighborhood. Our seat was ready earlier than later.  Things were cramped but, again, it didn't negatively affect my experience.  We both ordered the burger with the shoestring fries and it was AWESOME.  My skinny friend who ""wasn't too hungry"" when we got there, finished her whole burger - as did I.  The fries were sooo good, mixed with fresh rosemary and mingled with roasted garlic.  The burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time.  They melt Roquefort cheese on 'm certainly glad that I did.   So yeah, the crowd was eclectic, the service was good and the food was excellent.

It is a walking neighborhood, great for walking before or after dinner. The restaurant is famous, so the expectations are already there. It is, what I like to call, a memorabilia type bar; you know the ones that have walls covered with every kind of eye candy imaginable, great for getting conversations started even for the dimmest of minds. The place has been packed both times I have been there and we waited, not too long, but had enough time for a drink. I have been seated upstairs on both meals and the feel doesn't change much. We had started to look at the menu while waiting, placed our order and the culinary experience began. Joanne and I tried a a couple of bar snacks, plates, entrees and sides. We shared everything: just right for two with drinks. Seasoned well, constructed flavors and textures, presentation beautiful, the culinary experience is truly great. I'm a beer guy but they have full service bar and wines. The style is relaxed, perfect for those casual moments to grab a bite to eat on the fly.

Of course we couldn't get out of the Spotted Pig without trying their cask ale.  We tried the Brooklyn Brown Ale, which of course was great as a cask ale. I would love to come back here.  I think brunch was a muted menu of course, so coming back here during dinner and try the real menu of a Michelin stared bar!",1

Just like everything in NYC space is tight, but it only adds to the charm. We actually sat upstairs, food came out rather quick even though I order the Cuban sandwich which does take some time to prepare. My impression of the place is more of a bar with food, versus a full on restaurant. I could see meeting friends here for a snack or a couple of beers before heading out for the night. I really do like the look of the place and the food was not bad.",0

Yet every dish seemed to fall short of perfection and ultimate balance. -the roquefort severely overpowering the (delicious) burger meat.   -The lemon/citrus of two salads too acidic. -the oysters too small, the horseradish too overpowering -duck pie too buttery -skirt steak was good albeit overpriced. -the deviled eggs(better than good) and the pate toast. (mmm).  It was the table consensus so either it was a slightly off day or Every dish could have been AMAZING but the meal in itself ended up being just - good. $280 for four for salads, burgers, and a few drinks is a bit overpriced, no? Still, a four, BUT, it could be so much better. Father's Office(LA) still takes the nod with a bigger beer selection and better food.",1
126225,1814,4.0,1,2008-01-02,"So, I was there with my friend who is trying to taste the food of all 10 of the Food and Wine magazine's top10 new chefs.  April wasn't there, but the food gets this  It's nothing more than what it claims to , high end pub food.  Our deviled eggs had a touch more sophistication than the average egg.  Just a nice kick of cayenne at the end.  The chicken liver toasts were decadent.  There was a little texture left, but not too much.  The toast was perfect, though it was a touch salty.  I was glad that I shared the order, as it was very rich, but it's supposed to be rich.  I'm all about rich food that is what it should be.  Don't find fault with a chicken for being a chicken people!  Get over it! For lunch, we shared the gnudi, and the chowder.  The chowder was a bit salty for me, but the gnudi were heavenly. Very light, decadent, and perfectly seasoned.  This food all goes great with beer, as all pub food should, and the Southampton White I had was a great balance.   We split a sliceof Bananoffee Pie, which again, was decadent. I have the recipe, and I'm determined to make it now.  I'd go back again, and I've heard great things about the brussel sprouts, so I suppose that will be my next thing to try there, but until !   Why not a 5?  Some dishes were a bit too salty, and though we didn't have to wait for a table when we went (I was shocked really), the service was very friendly, but rather slow.  It took about 15 minutes to get our check.  I'm glad I didn't have anywhere to go to right after.",1

I opted for a lunch option, I had the Cubano, which had roast pork, spec, jalapeos and gruyre cheese (I think) with an arugula salad.  They say it take an extra 15 minutes to prepare, for what reason, I have no idea.  It was good, but the pork was a bit salty, but I like salty so it worked out for me (the salad was even salty).  The banana French toast was really good, the banana's were prepared great.  The frittata was good, nothing extra ordinary. I understand that it was to take an extra 15 minutes, but the table next to us ordered after us, got their food before and were almost finished before ours came, what's with that?  And it wasn't crowded, so that is not an excuse.  Oh well, it was a good thing we were not in a hurry.  So the bad service worked out in our favor. None of the stools have backs, which I find rather annoying, epically when the food is not 'cheap', I guess it is a cute little thing, but I like to lean back, the stools cannot be good for your back.  Also not good for groups over 6 I would say, it might be possible, , but far overpriced.  It was nice to try, maybe dinner service is different. The restrooms are cramped little private stalls, but very clean and well stocked.  One of the few air dryers that actually dry your hands.  4.25 Flushes.",0

Unfortunately, however, I don't see myself going back here. FOOD: 2 stars DRINKS: 4 stars They have a very interesting menu, at least in my opinion because I rarely eat British (mostly those that had been strongly recommended by our friends), like the sheep's ricotta gnudi, the bone marrow, the pickles, the sauteed quail w/trevise & pomegranate, the grilled skirt steak w/horseradish & beets, and the burger w/roquefort cheese & shoestrings. Our most favorite was the ricotta gnudi - rich and tasty. The plate of bone marrow was extremely heavy and tasted like pure grease. I should've noted Rotarded Ro Ro's warning on the sodium level beforehand, because all of the entrees were way too salty for us. I had a burger for the first time in 1.5 , theirs was salty. So were the fries on the side. The desserts - the banoffee pie and the walnut, chocolate & amaretto cake - were passable. Note: Prepare to wait.

I only go here on weeknights when the ""i saw it in US Weekly"" crowd isn't running rampant with eyes jetting from one side or another trying to locate a B list celeb that they will point and snicker at for hours. Yes, this has been witnessed time and time again. Weeknights, its usually just the neighborhood crowd and much more laid back. The food--delish. The ricotta gnuddi with brown butter and sage is absolutely delectable. Orgasmic. Don't need men if I ate this everyday but I would be about 500 pounds so I woundn't exactly be a guy magnet!",1
100760,1814,5.0,1,2007-12-12,"I am normally reluctant to write the 15023452nd review of a popular place. But Spotted Pig deserves it. We came there on a Tuesday night at about 9pm. We got an appalling 1 hour 45 minute wait time for a table. My friend who turned away being told that there's a 2 hour wait time, noticed that the wait times are lower if you're good looking, so she's going to hit the place with a push-up bra next time. But being a man, I couldn't really do push-up bras. I didn't care about the wait time and just barged in - I always find a way. There were people standing and waiting for bar spots. Within 5 minutes we secured two places at a bar, ordered a beer (good but expensive), and proceeded to order food at the bar itself. It reminded me of getting food in Japan. The place was swarming with well-dressed British-looking glamor types, and I was impressed when the waitress could distinguish between Irish and Scottish accents. I've tasted the liver - deliciously made, very buttery inside (almost feared that it's still raw), I loved it even though I normally hate liver. I wanted to see if a master chef can make something horrible taste good. And yes, they can. The best liver of my life. I've also tried the burger. It left me speechless, and I still have warm and fuzzy memories of it. Other Yelpers have described it in more detail. In its perfectly toasted buttery juiciness and blue cheesy spiciness the best burger of my life, at ""only"" the double the price of the average NYC pub burger. The shoestring fries were interesting: they fried them with onion and rosemary, and sprinkled with a lot of salt. I'd actually prefer less salt and would add it myself if necessary.",1

So I was delighted to hear that T wanted to try this place.  I was super duper excited about coming to the place that 's been highly praised. Since I am crossing to unfamiliar territory - I opted to take a cab since I still do not understand the streets of West Village. I never know where I am when I pass beyond 6th Avenue.   I spotted the spotted pig and went inside to wait for T's arrival.  T was lost and she called to ask me for directions - I am like dude, it's like the blind leading the blind situation. Finally T arrives and we sat promptly because it was still before 7 pm. We decided to share the following: Deviled Eggs -which never arrived, so can't judge it! Devils on Horsebacks -sweet and smokey all at the same time.  (Prunes wrapped in bacon!) Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage -A bit too salty for my taste, but it was still delish Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings -WHOA!  Extra SALTY!  I couldn't eat it.  I am sorry but I have an Asian palate and I can't do that much sodium.  I ended up focusing on dipping my shoestring fries with ketchup. We didn't get any desserts - since there really wasn't anything that appealed to us. This place was super duper crowded when we left around 7:30.

Am I crazy? Are the burgers here THAT good? Are their Gnudies (gnocchi) that delicious? Are their Devils on Horseback that worth the wait??? The answers , Yes, Yes!!!! YES!!! I just have one word for you: GNUDIES. Can I say it's like a party in your mouth? Sex on a plate? So delicious. So buttery, , they just ooooooze flavor. Best gnocchi I ever had. These alone are worth 5 stars. The Devils on Horseback were the reason why we came here. Ok, and the burgers, too. The Devils on Horseback were really delicious. I can't think of a better combination of dates with goat cheese wrapped in bacon. Hello, it's like the winning combination of lottery numbers or something. Now, for the final finale, we all got the burger. The char-grilled burger with shoestring fries. As we were waiting for our table, I saw endless plates of burgers going by eager eaters at this restaurant. Let me tell you, I was like a moth attracted to a light bulb. I kinda feel The Spotted Pig cheated. I mean, their burger had roquefort cheese and the buns were toasted with butter. How could anyone NOT like it?? The meat was juicy and , well, cheese! Did I mention the buns are toasted in butter? And the fries. Love shoestring fries. Just the right amount of salt, garlip chips and rosemary tossed in. (Ok, my breath not so good right now.) Great flavor all around and really unique. Apparently, Ivanka Trump was there when we were hanging out by the bar right before we got seated but I certainly didn't see her. I was too busy gawking at my neighbor's burger with shoestring fries. Overall, fantastic food and scene. Subtract one star for the crazy long wait for ordinary peeps like me. --------------------------- Went back on Friday night (12/7)... had some serious cravings for the gnuddies and the , why are their burgers and fries SO salty? After one bite of the burger, I had to scrape the cheese off to make it less salty! (So sad I had to do that but still, I couldn't eat it. Too salty.) Please ease up on the salt shaker. I drank so much water that night and next day!! Water retention is not cute! I also did try the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart, which was delicious.

It's kind of a pedigree list; if you're in this guide or that ranking, you're automatically in the circle. So I do have to say that even if I were just a normal Joe I'd still give this place five stars. You can't blame a guy for really loving the burger here at the Pig, because it's so freaking delicious. Roquefort that's almost melty over an onion brioche. I'm practically drooling just writing that down. Did I mention you get a mountain of rosemary shoestrings with this? Double drool. Wash it down with a beer on tap or something from the bar (it's extensive because it's a gastropub, after all) -- ask a bartender or your waiter for a recommendation on either, and they'll point you in the right direction. They have a limited menu between lunch and dinner; considering that only a few things are cooked at the time there's still a lot to try. Duck eggs with bottarga (mullet roe) are a great unusual treat and so are the roll mops (herring fillets). As you know, I'm already a sucker for chicken liver, and they have liver toasts here that are to die for. If you don't want to wait for a table (call ahead!) you can try and snag a seat at the bar. They'll serve you food there. And if you're trying to be really sneaky when it's busy, head upstairs and bypass the giant crowd by the bar because there's another floor with its own bar.

It is not a place I recommend for groups or very large people (seating is tight), and don't ever go on your first date you may run out of things to go before you even start your meal!",1
38438,1814,3.0,1,2007-10-03,Went on a week night and it was hella crowded.  Fun.  Had the burger and thought it was too salty with the roquefort cheese.  Excellent beer though.  Def a place to check out once.,0
52287,1814,4.0,1,2007-10-01,I like a good beer joint. Especially a British one. It reminds me of all the fun I had putting on 20lbs doing a college semester abroad. On top of that the food is quite lovely (done in my very best accent). The Gnudi was a great way to spark my appetite. The burger was clearly one of the best of ever eaten. Fun place!!,1
57121,1814,4.0,1,2007-09-13,Hate that's it's way too crowded but love the area and I am addicted to the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter and Sage!  I haven't been back in a bout a year and a half (before the place started to get all the hype) and can't wait to go back when I come into the city next week (from Austin). Will update if needed.,1

16059,1814,5.0,1,2007-08-29,"did i care that i waited for an hour to eat at this place? absolutely not. after what i had, it was worth every minute of  waiting. me and my friend sat down, starving, looked around us and everybody's plate just looked soooo , fried pig ears, a summer string bean salad and calf liver steak. everything was so tasty that me and my friend barely spoke while we were eating. the waitstaff was super friendly and since i sat right by the kitchen i could see all those lady chefs working really hard in that tini kitchen. Mario Batali dropped by the kitchen also in all his orange clogs glory. oh what a great dinner i had. sooo going back.",1
12952,1814,3.0,1,2007-08-28,"Spotted Pig is so trendy and crowded, I'm a little mixed on how I feel about the place. On the one hand, I have had only good experiences with the staff, so that's a good thing. But I've visited a handful of times for drinks, on various nights, at different times, and every time, it's been packed, both upstairs and down. Insanely packed. That's a sign of its popularity, but it's a little uncomfortable to be pushed around by other girls' purses (or elbows or butts), knocked in the head, or constantly squished up against my friends. Anyway, everyone raves about the burger, and I have to say, it's pretty darned good. I've seen a lot of Yelpers  comment on the burger being too salty, but I think it's the cheese, cuz to me, the burger itself was just fine, in fact, it was perfectly cooked. Anyway, I really liked it, and the shoestring fries with fried slices of garlic and fried rosemary are fantastic. I  would love to try to gnudi next, since I've read a lot of compliments about that too. Overall, I've always had a good time here, I just wish it weren't so crowded!",0

21591,1814,4.0,1,2007-08-23,"When I first learned this place was supposed to be a British establishment, it was an instant no brainer that I'd make my way here.  The wait was almost nilch as my dining companion and I got extremely lucky and was seated upstairs away from the crowd and got our own intimate corner for quiet chats and privacy.  As I've witnessed in the past, this was a pure stroke of luck as it can get crazy busy and crowded, similar to Cafe Habana wait time.  Our seating location unfortunately made it difficult to get the waitress' attention, who sadly was fighting through crowds of her own all of whom (like the English) were cheering to each other in a round of pints. The food took a long time to make so I decided to try some of their cocktails.  They were expensive (mojito - $12) but incredibly strong.  Thank goodness I can hold my alcohol or I would've been trouble.  The appetizer was their famous Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi, which tasted like rich macaroni and cheese balls. They had a touch of cinnamon tasting brown butter / sage, spawning a sweet but heavenly taste.    We also had some prunes wrapped in bacon and dipped in honey, known affectionately as Devil's on Horseback .  It was so divine that I could've eaten a whole plate full of them.  The clam chowder was soupy, but full of flavor.  They weren't skimpy with the meat as it was quite a hearty bowl.  The main attraction of the night was the hamburger which didn't disappoint.  It was juicy, semi-large, and full of flavor.  The shoe string fries were a nice touch, probably to allow more to room to finish the food, similar to the lobster roll at Pearl Oyster. The bill on the other hand was another story.  While the food is good, the prices are fairly up there.  Two people with drinks, an appetizer or two, plus an entree could easily hit $100 with tip.  Its recommended to split appetizers and share entrees so that the cost per person isn't too overwhelming.  Long love the pig!",1
76686,1814,5.0,1,2007-08-14,"Had dinner here tonight for the 1st time and it was Fantastic!!! After reading several of the reviews and long-wait horror stories, we showed-up around 6:30pm and waited for 1/2 a minute! No joke! We walked in, asked for a table and they said, ""It'll only be 1/2 a minute while we set-up your table."" With smiles on our faces from the great news, we turned around, ordered a drink at the bar, and was literally motioned to our table a few seconds later. It really was ONLY 1/2 a minute, if that! Our waitress was a delight and recommended a few of the popular dishes there. We had the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage, Greek Salad, and Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings. My taste buds were in heaven!!! The Greek Salad was 'oh so fresh!' Perfect for a warm summer evening! The Gnudi was divine and melts in your mouth! My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. M! That burger will never be forgotten and I will sing its praises all the way back to San Francisco! Although The Spotted Pig is a small establishment, it is Perfect just the way it is! Even as we left, I asked for a nearby fro-yo location and they were as nice as could be. They didn't know where Pinkberry was but they tried to help me find one nonetheless! I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu favorites! New York City, I think I am falling in love.",1

They can call them what they want but I swear to god these are made of mystical, magical, sparkly unicorn meat.  SOOOOOOO Good!   I love them so much that while at Chateau's Bar Marmont (LA) where ex-SP Sous Chef is now leading the kitchen, I asked Carolynn Spence to recreate them for me.

21678,1814,5.0,1,2007-07-13,"I ordered the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings and my date got the cubano sandwich with arugula salad. The burger was absolutely AWESOME with the roquefort (I thought the cheese was good, but can be on the strong side for people that usually just get American/Cheddar). The shoestring fries tasted very similar to the marcona almonds with rosemary that you can find at Trader Joe's (maybe because the shoestring fries were fried WITH rosemary). The cubano 've had since Potbelly's (a chain from the midwest - if you're ever in the Chicago area, you HAVE to get an Italian with hot )! Actually, I take that back since Mary's Fish Camp AND the Pearl Oyster bar have awesome lobster rolls/sandwiches. Anyway, the cubano sandwich had pulled pork, pickles, grilled cheese, all put on a crusty piece of french bread. It was AMAZING! The arugula salad was lightly dressed with a lemony dressing (also great).  Our waiter was ?  Well, not 't want to be rude, but he was the type that's in his own world at times.  If I had to compare him to anyone from television, I'd compare him to Phoebe Buffet from Friends.  You know, sometimes they're just not all there?   The Spotted Pig is a great place for lunch (if Bill Clinton eats there, you should, too!) and I would go there all the time if the food wasn't so likely to give me a premature heart attack.",1
101514,1814,3.0,1,2007-07-04,"This place can be hit or miss for me.  I have gone and had a blast and I have gone and felt squished and uncomfortable.  I think it really depends on the mood, company and night of any given visit. The food was always great though.  I have dreams about their shoe string fries!!  My mouth waters at the thought of them and I always see a celbrity or too (yes - I will admit to being a big dork that gets excited seeing someone even tangentially famous).   It is on the expensive side but both the food and wine merit the price.  Just don't come on a night when you are on a budget or in a rush.  Come with a group of freinds on a night you want to stand around (finding a seat at the bar can be tough) and have a few drinks and would be just as happy ordering appetizers at the bar or are fully willing to put in a long wait for a table.",0

This delicate starter would be hard to share!  I recommend getting two, unless you're accompanied by a vegan or one who doesn't care to try duck eggs. To die for:  Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter and Sage (It looks like a small dish but after the first gnudi (you get six), you might think twice that it is!) Let's be real here!  In a city that never sleeps, don't expect to NOT have a long wait.  Besides, why not take this opportunity to be creative while waiting (; or enjoy a Galoise and watch the world go by).  Paul Rudd can pop in looking for someone and you may even get to see his most current !  You would be surprised at how the time just passes and !  It's worth the wait!  ...But you may just get lucky to not have to.",1
126235,1814,5.0,1,2007-06-21,"The appetizers are pricey, but worth it for the quality. The burger was incredible and a complete contrast to the huge greasy stack of meat from the Corner Bistro nearby.  The meat was remarkably light and fluffy, like a marshmallow.  I don't know how they do it, but it's an impressive technique.  You have to try it to understand.  This burger will truly blow you away. The Cuban sandwich that's only available at lunchtime is worth a trip in the middle of the day, it's the most amazing version of a pork sandwich you'll ever taste. Thumbs down on the Spotted Pig cask ale though, it tasted something like a 50/50 blend of PBR with Saranac ale.  Maybe it is a deliberate blend of lowbrow meets middle class (ironically, in an extravagantly priced neighborhood) that they are going for?  I expected a bit more from the draft selection. Update:  Months later, and I've moved to the left coast, and I have dreams about eating here. They can't make a burger like this anywhere in LA, not even Father's Office. Oh how I miss SP! If I had time for only one meal in all of Manhattan, I am pretty sure I'd be here.",1

I just really like the 's small and intimate and the service has been good thus far. Great place for a date~ There was however, one occasion where the wait staff was really slow in bringing our food. And the wait (to be seated) of course can get really out of control, so plan for a wait and to take things leisurely. the few times I've been there I happened to be seated next to Molto Mario aka Mario Batali from the Food Network, Lars Ulrich- drummer from Metallica, and Ross from Friends, David Schwimmer is it? and various soap opera folk from As the World Turns I *heart* The Spotted Pig for its great food and atmosphere~",1
38443,1814,4.0,1,2007-05-11,"I'm really on the fence about this place- three stars or four? It's definitely a fun spot for early or late drinks (prime hours the place is packed and way uncomfortable), and the food is pretty good. That being said, I've noticed the quality of this place go downhill after renovation, so I'll just share a few differences I noticed after they expanded. First of all- the pricing's gone up while the food quality's gone down. I'm sure they've gotta cut some corners and charge more to make a bigger profit, but it's really been a disservice to the customers. The first time I went I had some amazing gnocchi (probably the best I'd had in New York!) but on second trip, the portions were way smaller and the gnocchi was gummy as hell. I'm also not a huge fan of the new upstairs space. It feels much more formal than downstairs, which maybe some people are into, but if I'm going to a gastropub, I want it to feel more like a pub and less like it's trying to be Town or another Jeffrey Zacharian joint. The service here has always been a tad snotty-- do I not look appropriately moneyed enough for you folks?-- but the last time I went it was ridiculous. Our waitress didn't come by for at least 20 minutes, and I ended up ordering our drinks at the bar. Not cool. Anyways, I think this place has promise to be great again, so I'll leave the four stars up. But don't say I didn't warn you!",1

Spotted P, figurines, paintings, brass ornaments.  Yes, it was quirky.  The set up is quirky itself--upstairs, there were tables placed wherever they could fit.. weird arrangement but it works.  The place was packed to the max but we managed to get a table without waiting at all.  SCORE! From the lunch menu, which I found a bit limited, I ordered the chicken panini dish (don't see it on the menu anymore).. tasty, good sides to accompany the sandwich and bread was not too hard.  Everyone else near our table ordered the hamburger which comes with wonderful roquert cheese.  It looked sooo good from where I was sitting, I made a quick and easy decision on what I was ordering the next time I frequented the SP.  Lastly, the coffee was amazing.  It comes in the french carafes that you push down to ""brew"" your own  Strong, a bit dark with a hint of cocoa, it was the best cup of coffee served to me in a restaurant setting so far.

Once upstairs, as loud and crowded as the place seemed, it had a really cozy feel to it-- esp that we were seated near a semi-private little nook. We ordered the appetizer special-  chicken liver chorizo ( a little spicy and amazingly delicious; I am a chicken liver fan to begin with). A yummy appetizer to go with our Speckled Hen beer! We shared a rabbit entree (so glad the waitress did not give us any wierd looks about sharing; it was late evening and we did not feel like a ""full"" dinner).  Rabbit was very moist and tender. Overall, the food was good, and the atmostphere great-- an energetic, happy crowd.  I'd probably avoid this place on the weekends, as I can imagine how long the wait would be, esp with larger groups.",1

Oh well, the hostess was very friendly and took down our phone number so we could beast tequila and eat nachos at a neighboring bar in the meantime - Spotted Pig's was too crowded. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and all our appetizers were good - but nothing was out of this world. However, my dinner, the blue cheese burger was fantastic - definitely on par with SF's delicious gourmet burgers of RNM and NOPA. But honestly, the place didn't strike me as amazing. The inside is cramped and dark, all wood and crowded. I think the most notable thing about Spotted Pig is that the waiters actually get the food to your table in one piece despite the pervasive mobs. Literally, you could not move in the building. At one point, I cracked a joke and the table of two next to us laughed. I mean, we were practically a table of 5. I think we talked about golf - which must've been interesting because my knowledge of sport extends only slightly past the fact that I think Tiger is cool.",1

A perfect upstairs, with light streaming in through the corner glass window and illuminating a stand of wildflowers atop the bar. The fixtures and appointments throughout the room carried a mirthful, comic flair. The room was predictably swimming with scenesters and tourists, but not enough to kill the rather excellent vibe: felt like I'd stepped into a record party for The Beatles sometime deep in the 1970s. (That's the best I can do here.) My fiancee and I were left reeling by the squid with potatoes, the roasted beets and sprouts, the gnudi. The wine list looked unpromising, although a pricey viognier passed muster, and the prosecco was fun. Avoid the Prima Victory pilsner, which is poured warm.

And why, you ask?  Because the Spotted Pig is always fun and the food is excellent.  It implements the ideas behind the gastropub in its own unique fashion.  We've had different things from the speck and the gnudi to the burger, rosemary fries, and some kind of choucroute-ish thing the exact origin of which I can't remember at the moment, and all were delicious.  The ginger cake (huge piece btw) was awesome and authentic.   Chocolate cake not too shabby either. They have a decent and quirky wine list with some values on it, but more than that they have amazing beer suitable for even the most particular British citizen--cask conditioned choices alongside a great drought and bottle beer list.  Last time we were there they had their own housemade Spotted Pig bitter in a cask and my Scottish husband was in heaven.  The servers--I have nothing but complete admiration for them, having to navigate through the crowds and still seem like they don't mind it.  Always cool. Besides all this, the atmosphere is what makes the Spotted Pig experience complete.  It's always great for people-watching, and there is always some sort of celebrity there.  It seems like there are a lot of regulars from the neighborhood as well.  And the crush of people works in your favor, strangely enough--since you're pushed into a corner while waiting or eating, you seem like you have your very own private place.  It's actually romantic, believe it or not!  And you can even get away with almost having sex right there in the dining room because no one can see anything.  Trust me. ;-) One word of advice:  the door staff does their best and are surprisingly very sweet when they could be pretentious, but sometimes things happen and names fall off the list for tables, so check back if you've waited for more than an hour.  Don't be a pest, mind you--just make sure they don't think you left, or else you'll have to wait even longer.",1

We ended up waiting almost an hour before we were seated but evidently, an hour wait is a 'walk in the park' for a table here. We had the Gnocchi as an app which was delightfully rich and filling.  For entree's, we ordered: -Burger & string fries (my friend and I split) - Calves liver (my SO) - Cheese plate (other friend) - Beets (side) - Broccoli (side) It was all very delish, esp the burger.  I acutally never eat burger's and can't recall the last time I touched one but, I thought I'd live on the edge and give it a try!  It was good but not enough to convert me into becoming a carnivore.  Everything was yummy and : -Lemon & lime pie - Flourless Chocolate cake The lemon & lime pie was the better outta the , our server was xcellent and attentive.  I would come back just cuz it's a nice and cozy pub.  The only caveat is, if I didn't have an ""in"", I don't think I'd be willing to wait for over 1+ ",1

Our server was incredibly friendly and would appear at all the right moments. Just happened to be a friday during Lent, so I enjoyed my 5-veggie plate (mostly my favorite winter vegetables roasted and excellent ""champ"") and watched my friends have meat orgasms while consuming their burgers.

This pub is so crowded and although that is such a drag, I can see why people love this place and why there is always a long wait. The food is delicious. We had almost everything. The burger is ok and overrated but the shoestring fries are fantastic. The apps were all good such as the gnudi stuffed with ricotta. Even the artichoke salad was good and I hate salads! The braised ribs dish is a winner. Desserts were decent. The flourless chocolate cake and warm ginger cake are divine. I would go back. There is a very fun and down to earth vibe to this place and the crowd is so social and friendly! Will definitely go back.",1

91618,1814,3.0,1,2006-09-23,Terribly disappointing but not my favorite type of food either.  What is all the fuss about?  No wait at 6:30pm on a Thursday.,0
126241,1814,3.0,1,2006-09-22,"OK. I have skimmed through the reviews below, and I do agree with most, but I am going to be the hard bastard yelper here and offer what I think is a better alternative for the price. However, I will first bore you with my review. You can always skip to the end for my alternative places to eat --- but you will miss the juicy bit! Had dinner at The Spotted Pig on Friday night, had no problems with needing to book. Arrived between 7:30 and 8pm, and was seated straight away; all be it the table was not the best. In terms of the 'venue', it's basically a bar that sells food.  The concept that it has followed from the UK seems to be intact, but with an American bias.  The UK concept is spruced up British pub that has kicked out the pissed locals smoking loads of fags crowing the bar, and replaced them with trendy people that want a somewhat more refined experience in the cosyness of a pub.  I should also say that the food at Gastro pubs is normally (and should be) local and organic and not fussed with; The Spotted Pig would appear to follow this formula.   For dinner we shared and shared.  To start we shared the pig's ear, yes pigs ear.  Now this starter was $14, which is a lot for a pig's ear, given that it is not a prime cut of meat, but you are paying for the thrill of trying pig's ear, or at least we were.  The pig's ear was cooked a la confit duck, and served with endive and tender rocket and a caper dressing.  The ear was actually quite nice, strong in flavor with the duck fat, but it was difficult to eat --- no good if you have any dodgy teeth!  Anyway it was fun (but not $14 worth --- an ear what, 5c, they give them to pets for free, right!) For main course we shared the burger with those fries and chard. All great.  Burger cooked as we asked, fries sport on and chard spot on --- all spot on and yummy. The cost for our simple meal with 2 beers and a couple of coffees 70$ plus tip. Now here's where I will offer two alternatives.   If you just want a burger and fries and are a bit thrifty with your cash (and are in the location) the Broome Street Bar does a top burger that rivals the burgers at The Spotted Pig, and the fries are good to.  A burger at the Broome is between 8$ and $9, with a side of fries that is more than enough for two for a few dollars.  So if you're already downtown and on a limited budget, consider Broome. My second reason for an alternative goes like this.  The most expensive main at The Pig was $32 dollars for scallops, that's a lot.  The least expensive apart from the burger was $24, still quite a lot,.  All starters are about $12 - $14 not cheap. This puts it in restaurant territory!  if you are out with friends and up for a couple of courses each and some wine, and in the fortunate position to order from any part of the menu, I would recommend The Tasting Rooms on Elizabeth Street. The tasting rooms has the same relaxed atmosphere, with waiting staff in denim, but has more space, not so noisy, and I bet the bills would add up to about the same -  may be a little more in The Tasting Rooms.  But for those extra few bucks, you get space, better food, and a better dinning experience.  However, if you get lured by those great cocktails and the fancy wine --- BOOM - grab that credit card as it's gone do some chin ups!. I don't want to put The Spotted Pig down, as I liked it, just over priced for the surrounding.  Do give it a go, the cooking and food is good, but I just think there is better value to be found in NYC.   I have rated it only three based on cost.  On food it would be an easy four.",0

126242,1814,5.0,1,2006-08-21,"When I visited NYC a while back I was wandering the city by foot and came across this cute little gastro-pub I'd never seen 't hungry or thirsty --- since I'd just eaten at Pastis - but it was too cute not to pop in and take a look. Once inside my friend and I got caught up in conversation with a server and two bartenders who were so friendly (defying the typical NYC stereotype --- haha ;) that we stayed on for a drink (or three!) just to chat a little longer. We didn't actually try the food, but everything we saw them serving was beautiful and looked so scrumptious we'll no doubt go back to have a taste next time. I just can't say enough for the quaint and hip, yet laid back ""flea market chic"" of design of The Spotted Pig and the friendly, helpful staff. I've read some of the other reviews and can see why this would be a long wait, or celebrity attraction, but I would just recommend going early and taking in the more laid back late afternoon / early evening scene when you can enjoy it a little more and not feel rushed or claustrophobic. I'm going to upload a photo to show you how cute Spotted Pig is and also the sweet bartenders :)",1
9932,1814,3.0,1,2006-06-24,"I knew that the wait was going to be intense but after an hour and forty-five minutes I just started to feel like an idiot! The city is full of great restaurants and on a Tuesday night I know I shouldn't be waiting this long for elevated pub food! But the Spotted Pig is a super-scene right now and yes, the burger that I ordered was exceedingly delicious. Full on with beefy flavour, soft and tender, appealingly rare. The shoestring fries with bits of roasted garlic and rosemary are initially quite tasty, but my complaint with shoestring fries is that they are somewhat difficult to get into one's mouth (fork? scoop up 20 at a time with your hands?) and they get cold quickly. So, yes, I'm glad that I went to the Spotted Pig but I don't think that I'll be rushing to go back.",0

Really great irish coffee and wulled wine, although the wine can get a little too saturated with spices. The upstairs tables are covered with rough brown paper sheets [on top of the white table cloths, of course!] which makes a perfect surface for writing/drawing/whatever.

The comfortable dark-wood and exposed-brick interior, featuring carved pigs and drawings of assorted produce, provides a homey background for the eclectic menu. Goat cheese and hazelnuts sprinkled with flecks of lemon zest combine with either Jerusalem artichokes or grilled octopus for an outstanding salad to start. Calf's liver, lightly sauteed with sage and onions, and roast halibut in a parsley sauce, served with mashed potatoes, were delectable, but the moderately-priced entrees are served in smallish portions, and hearty appetites will need to order a la carte sides - a plate of five seasonal vegetables easily will serve two - to supplement their main course. Warm ginger cake splashed with vanilla cream is good, but disappointingly the dessert list doesn't include more traditional options.
