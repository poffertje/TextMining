The reviewContent file contains the review text and metadata file contains meta information in the following order
 
user_id 
prod_id 
rating 
label 
date

For feature extraction you need both files. For running the LBP you need the reviewGraph (user_id(1 .. N), prod_id(1 ... M), rating) file. The other two files are just mapping of original user_id and product_id to a unique number for reviewGraph representation. Based on this structure you might need to change some lines of code in initialization.
